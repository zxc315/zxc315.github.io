<p>
    <font>Endowment, established in 1997 by a $1 million gift from (1970 UF graduate) Mason&nbsp;</font>

<p>
    <font>Introduction:</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;The Graham-Buffett Course sequence is important to this college because it enables us to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>attract students who want this perspective on investing and managing corporations—a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>perspective that has been successfully employed by Mr. Buffett, Mr. Hawkins and before&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>them, Benjamin Graham.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>This perspective is quite simple but is sometimes lost in the complexity of our University&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>analysis.&nbsp; The perspective is that you have to understand the underlying economics of the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businesses that you invest in, work in.&nbsp; You have to be clear-eyed and not be swayed by&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the crowd or passing fancies of the moment. And you have to learn and stick to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>disciplined principles of business valuation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>In the long run this disciplined approach will more often than not bring success or more&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>importantly avoid spectacular failures.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Hopefully at the University of Florida we can successfully convey those principles and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>create a program for the very best students and in time the very best employers as well.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We thank Mr. Hawkins for his gift ($1 million) and share his thoughts today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Mason Hawkins:&nbsp; He is someone I have admired tremendously for the last 30 years. In&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>addition, he is someone each of us could pattern our lives after as a role model.&nbsp; It is my&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>honor to introduce our lifetime's best long-term investor…… -------------&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: (holds mike) Testing: One million $, two million $….three million $.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I would like to say a few words primarily and then the highlight for me will be getting&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>your questions. I want to talk about what is on your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Your Future</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;I would like to talk for just one minute to the students about your future when you leave&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>here. Because you will learn a tremendous amount about investments, you all have the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>ability to do well; you all have the IQ to do well. You all have the energy and initiative to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>do well or you wouldn't be here.&nbsp; Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspirations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>1&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But in determining whether you succeed there is more to it than intellect and energy. I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>would like to talk just a second about that. In fact, there was a guy, Pete Kiewit in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Omaha, who used to say, he looked for three things in hiring people: integrity,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>intelligence and energy.&nbsp; And he said if the person did not have the first two, the later two&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>would kill him, because if they don't have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We want to talk about the first two because we know you have the last two. You are all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>second-year MBA students, so you have gotten to know your classmates.&nbsp; Think for a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>moment that I granted you the right--you can buy 10% of one of your classmate’s&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>earnings for the rest of their lifetime.&nbsp; You can't pick someone with a rich father; you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have to pick someone who is going to do it on his or her own merit.&nbsp; And I gave you an&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>hour to think about it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Will you give them an IQ test and pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it.&nbsp; Will you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>pick the one with the best grades?&nbsp; The most energetic?&nbsp; &nbsp;You will start looking for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>qualitative factors, in addition to (the quantitative) because everyone has enough brains&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and energy.&nbsp; You would probably pick the one you responded the best to, the one who&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>has the leadership qualities, the one who is able to get other people to carry out their&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>interests.&nbsp; That would be the person who is generous, honest and who gave credit to other&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>people for their own ideas.&nbsp; All types of qualities.&nbsp; Whomever you admire the most in the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>class. Then I would throw in a hooker.&nbsp; In addition to this person you had to go short one&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of your classmates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>That is more fun.&nbsp; Who do I want to go short?&nbsp; You wouldn't pick the person with the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>lowest IQ, you would think about the person who turned you off, the person who is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>egotistical, who is greedy, who cuts corners, who is slightly dishonest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>As you look at those qualities on the left and right hand side, there is one interesting thing&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about them, it is not the ability to throw a football 60 yards, it is not the ability the run the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>100 yard dash in 9.3 seconds, it is not being the best looking person in the class, they are&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>all qualities that if you really want to have the ones on the left hand side, you can have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>them.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>They are qualities of behavior, temperament, character that are achievable, they are not&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>forbidden to anybody in this group. And if you look at the qualities on the right hand side&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the ones that turn you off in other people, there is not a quality there that you have to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have.&nbsp; You can get rid of it. You can get rid of it a lot easier at your age than at my age,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>because most behaviors are habitual.&nbsp; The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are too heavy to be broken. There is no question about it.&nbsp; I see people with these self-&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>destructive behavior patterns at my age or even twenty years younger and they really are&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>entrapped by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>They go around and do things that turn off other people right and left. They don't need to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>be that way but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it.&nbsp; But at your age&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior that you wish.&nbsp; It is simply a question&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of which you decide.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>2&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If you did this…&nbsp; Ben Graham looked around at the people he admired and Ben Franklin&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>did this before him. Ben Graham did this in his low teens and he looked around at the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>people he admired and he said, "I want to be admired, so why don't I behave like them?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And he found out that there was nothing impossible about behaving like them.&nbsp; Similarly&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities. I would&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>suggest is that if you write those qualities down and think about them a while and make&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>them habitual, you will be the one you want to buy 10% of when you are all through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And the beauty of it is that you already own 100% of yourself and you are stuck with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>So you might as well be that person, that somebody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Well that is a short little sermon.&nbsp; So let's get on with what you are interested in.&nbsp; Let's&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>start with questions………..&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: What about Japan?&nbsp; Your thoughts about Japan?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; My thoughts about Japan?&nbsp; I am not a macro guy.&nbsp; Now I say to myself&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Berkshire Hathaway can borrow money in Japan for 10 years at one percent. One&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>percent!&nbsp; I say gee, I took Graham's class 45 years ago and I have been working hard at&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>this all my life maybe I can earn more than 1% annually, it doesn't seem impossible.&nbsp; I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>wouldn't want to get involved in currency risk, so it would have to be Yen-denominated. I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>would have to be in Japanese Real Estate or Japanese companies or something of the sort&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and all I have to do is beat one percent. That is all the money is going to cost me and I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>can get it for 10 years.&nbsp; So far I haven't found anything.&nbsp; It is kind of interesting.&nbsp; The&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Japanese businesses earn very low returns on equity - 4% to 5% - 6% on equity and it is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you are in doesn't earn very much&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Now some people do it.&nbsp; In fact, I have a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked at Graham&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>at the same time I did. And it was the first way I went at stocks to buy stocks selling way&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>below working capital.&nbsp; A very cheap, quantitative approach to stocks.&nbsp; I call it the cigar&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>butt approach to investing.&nbsp; You walk down the street and you look around for a cigar&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>butt someplace.&nbsp; Finally you see one and it is soggy and kind of repulsive, but there is one&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>puff left in it.&nbsp; So you pick it up and the puff is free--it is a cigar butt stock.&nbsp; You get one&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>free puff on it and then you throw it away and try another one.&nbsp; It is not elegant. But it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>works.&nbsp; Those are low return businesses.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But time is the friend of the wonderful business; it is the enemy of the lousy&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>business.&nbsp; If you are in a lousy business for a long time, you will get a lousy result even if&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you buy it cheap.&nbsp; If you are in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you pay a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>little bit too much going in you will get a wonderful result if you stay in a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I find very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present.&nbsp; They may change the culture in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>some way so that management gets more share holder responsive over there and stock&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>returns are higher.&nbsp; At the present time you will find a lot of low return businesses and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that was true even when the Japanese economy was booming.&nbsp; It is amazing; they had an&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>3&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>incredible market without incredible companies.&nbsp; They were incredible in terms of doing&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a lot of business, but they were not incredible in terms of the return on equity that they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>achieved and that has finally caught up with them.&nbsp; So we have so far done nothing there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But as long as money is 1% there, we will keep looking.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: You were rumored to be one of the rescue buyers of Long Term Capital,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what was the play there, what did you see?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; The Fortune Magazine that has Rupert Murdoch on the cover.&nbsp; It tells the whole&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>story of our involvement; it is kind of an interesting story. I got the really serious call&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about LTCM on a Friday afternoon that things were getting serious.&nbsp; I know those people&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>most of them pretty well--most of them at Salomon when I was there. And the place was&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>imploding and the FED was sending people up that weekend. Between that Friday and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the following Wed. when the NY Fed, in effect, orchestrated a rescue effort but without&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>any Federal money involved.&nbsp; I was quite active but I was having a terrible time reaching&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>anybody.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We put in a bid on Wednesday morning.&nbsp; I talked to Bill McDonough at the NY Fed.&nbsp; We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>made a bid for 250 million for the net assets but we would have put in 3 and 3/4 billion&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>on top of that.&nbsp; $3 billion from Berkshire, $700 mil. from AIG and $300 million. from&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Goldman Sachs. And we submitted that but we put a very short time limit on that because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>when you are bidding on 100 billion worth of securities that are moving around, you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>don't want to leave a fixed price bid out there for very long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>In the end the bankers made the deal, but it was an interesting period. The whole LTCM&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>is really fascinating because if you take Larry Hillenbrand, Eric Rosenfeld, John&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Meriwether and the two Nobel prize winners.&nbsp; If you take the 16 of them, they have about&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>as high an IQ as any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Microsoft.&nbsp; An incredible amount of intellect in one room. Now you combine that with&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the fact that those people had extensive experience in the field they were operating in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>These were not a bunch of guys who had made their money selling men’s clothing and all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of a sudden went into the securities business.&nbsp; They had in aggregate, the 16, had 300 or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>400 years of experience doing exactly what they were doing and then you throw in the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>third factor that most of them had most of their very substantial net worth’s in the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businesses.&nbsp; Hundreds and hundreds of millions of their own money up (at risk), super&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>high intellect and working in a field that they knew.&nbsp; Essentially they went broke.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>to me is absolutely fascinating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If I ever write a book it will be called, Why Smart People Do Dumb Things</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;.&nbsp; My partner&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>says it should be autobiographical.&nbsp; But this might be an interesting illustration.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>perfectly decent guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;I respect them and they helped me out when I had problems at&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Salomon.&nbsp; They are not bad people at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But to make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what they did need.&nbsp; That is just plain foolish; it doesn’t matter what your IQ is.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you it just&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>4&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>doesn’t make sense.&nbsp; I don’t care if the odds you succeed are 99 to 1 or 1000 to 1 that you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>succeed.&nbsp; If you hand me a gun with a million chambers with one bullet in a chamber and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>put it up to your temple and I am paid to pull the trigger, it doesn’t matter how much I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>would be paid.&nbsp; I would not pull the trigger.&nbsp; You can name any sum you want, but it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>doesn’t do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear. Yet&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>people do it financially very much without thinking.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>There was a lousy book with a great title written by Walter Gutman—You Only Have to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Get Rich Once</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;Now that seems pretty fundamental.&nbsp; If you have $100 million at the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>beginning of the year and you will make 10% if you are unleveraged and 20% if you are&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>leveraged 99 times out of a 100, what difference if at the end of the year, you have $110&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>million or $120 million?&nbsp; It makes no difference.&nbsp; If you die at the end of the year, the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>guy who makes up the story may make a typo, he may have said 110 even though you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>had a 120.&nbsp; You have gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference.&nbsp; It makes&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>no difference to your family or anybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The downside, especially if you are managing other people’s money, is not only losing all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>your money, but it is disgrace, humiliation and facing friends whose money you have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>lost.&nbsp; Yet 16 guys with very high IQs entered into that game.&nbsp; I think it is madness.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>produced by an over reliance to some extent on things.&nbsp; Those guys would tell me back at&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Salomon; a six Sigma event wouldn’t touch us.&nbsp; But they were wrong.&nbsp; History does not</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;tell you of future things happening.&nbsp; &nbsp;They had a great reliance on mathematics.&nbsp; They&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>thought that the Beta of the stock told you something about the risk of the stock. It&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>doesn’t tell you a damn thing about the risk of the stock in my view.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Sigma’s do not tell you about the risk of going broke in my view and maybe now in their&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>view too.&nbsp; But I don’t like to use them as an example.&nbsp; The same thing in a different way&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>could happen to any of us, where we really have a blind spot about something that is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>crucial, because we know a whole lot of something else.&nbsp; It is like Henry Kauffman said,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>“The ones who are going broke in this situation are of two types, the ones who know&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>nothing and the ones who know everything.”&nbsp; &nbsp;It is sad in a way.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I urge you. We basically never borrow money.&nbsp; I never borrowed money even when I had&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>$10,000 basically, what difference did it make.&nbsp; I was having fun as I went along it didn’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>matter whether I had $10,000 or $100,000 or $1,000,000 unless I had a medical&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>emergency come along.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I was going to do the same things when I had a little bit of money as when I had a lot of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>money.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you think of the difference between me and you, we wear the same clothes&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>basically (SunTrust gives me mine), we eat similar food—we all go to McDonald’s or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>better yet, Dairy Queen, and we live in a house that is warm in winter and cool in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>summer.&nbsp; We watch the Nebraska (football) game on big screen TV.&nbsp; You see it the same&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>way I see it. We do everything the same—our lives are not that different.&nbsp; The only thing&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we do is we travel differently.&nbsp; What can I do that you can’t do?&nbsp;</font>

    <font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I get to work in a job that I love, but I have always worked at a job that I loved. I loved it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>just as much when I thought it was a big deal to make $1,000.&nbsp; I urge you to work in jobs&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that you love</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>because you think it will look good on your resume.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was with a fellow at Harvard the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>other day who was taking me over to talk.&nbsp; He was 28 and he was telling me all that he&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>had done in life, which was terrific. And then I said, “What will you do next?”&nbsp; “Well,”&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>he said, “Maybe after I get my MBA I will go to work for a consulting firm because it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will look good on my resume.”&nbsp; I said, “Look, you are 28 and you have been doing all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>these things, you have a resume 10 times than anybody I have ever seen.&nbsp; Isn’t that a little&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>like saving up sex for your old age?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want.&nbsp; &nbsp;Take a job that you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>love.&nbsp; You will jump out of bed in the morning.&nbsp; When I first got out of Columbia&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Business School, I wanted to go to work for Graham immediately for nothing.&nbsp; He&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>thought I was over-priced. But I kept pestering him.&nbsp; I sold securities for three years and I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>kept writing him and finally I went to work for him for a couple of years. It was a great&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>experience. But I always worked in a job that I loved doing. You really should take a job&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that if you were independently wealthy that would be the job you would take. You will&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>learn something, you will be excited about, and you will jump out of bed.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>miss.&nbsp; You may try something else later on, but you will get way more out of it and I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>don’t care what the starting salary is.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>When you get out of here take a job you love, not a job you think will look good on your&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>resume. You ought to find something you like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If you think you will be happier getting 2x instead of 1x, you are probably making a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>mistake. You will get in trouble if you think making 10x or 20x will make you happier&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>because then you will borrow money when you shouldn’t or cut corners on things.&nbsp; It just&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>doesn’t make sense and you won’t like it when you look back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: What makes a company something that you like?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; I like businesses that I can understand.&nbsp; Let’s start with that.&nbsp; That narrows it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>down by 90%.&nbsp; There are all types of things I don’t understand, but fortunately, there is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there and almost every&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>company is publicly owned. So you have all American business practically available to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you.&nbsp; So it makes sense to go with things you can understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I can understand this, anyone can understand this (Buffett holds up a bottle of Coca</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Cola).&nbsp; Since 1886, it is a simple business, but it is not an easy business—I don’t want an&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>easy business for competitors.&nbsp; I want a business with a moat around it.&nbsp; I want a very&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>valuable castle in the middle and then I want the Duke who is in charge of that castle to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>be very honest and hard working and able. Then I want a moat around that castle.&nbsp; The&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>moat can be various things: The moat around our auto insurance business, Geico, is low&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>cost.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>6&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>People have</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;to buy auto insurance so everyone is going to have one auto insurance policy&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>per car basically.&nbsp; I can’t sell them 20, but they have to buy one. I can sell them 1.&nbsp; What&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are they going to buy it on? (based on what criteria?)&nbsp; They (customers) will buy based&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is identical among companies or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>close enough.&nbsp; So they will do it on cost.&nbsp; So I have to be a low cost producer--that is my&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>moat.&nbsp; To the extent that my costs are further below the other guy, I have thrown a couple&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of sharks into the moat. All the time you have this wonderful castle, there are people out&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>there who are going to attack it and try to take it away from you. I want a castle I can&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Kodak</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola’s moat.&nbsp; I mean if&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby and you want to look at that&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now.&nbsp; And you are never going to get a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>chance—you are not a professional photographer—so you can evaluate what is going to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>look good 20 or 50 years ago.&nbsp; What is in your mind about that photography company&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>(Share of Mind) is what counts.&nbsp; Because they are promising you that the picture you take&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>today is going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is very&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>important to you.&nbsp; Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that.&nbsp; They&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>had what I call share of mind</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Forget about share of market, share of mind.&nbsp; They had&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something—that little yellow box—that said Kodak is the best. That is priceless.&nbsp; They&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have lost some of that.&nbsp; They haven’t lost it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>It is not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job, but they let that moat narrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways.&nbsp; They let them get into&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Olympics. So Fuji gets there and immediately in people’s minds, Fuji becomes more into&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>parity with Kodak.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>You haven’t seen that with Coke; Coke’s moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>You can’t see the moat day by day but every time the infrastructure that gets built in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>some country that isn’t yet profitable for Coke that will be 20 years from now.&nbsp; The moat&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>is widening a little bit.&nbsp; Things are, all the time, changing a little in one direction or the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>other.&nbsp; Ten years from now, you will see the difference.&nbsp; Our managers of the businesses&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we run, I have one message to them, and we want to widen the moat.&nbsp; &nbsp;We want to throw&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>crocs, sharks and gators—I guess—into the moat to keep away competitors. That comes&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about through service, through quality of product, it comes about through cost, some&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>times through patents, and/or real estate location.&nbsp; So that is the business I am looking&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Now what kind of businesses am I going to find like that?&nbsp; Well, I am going to find them&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>in simple products because I am not going to be able to figure what the moat is going to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>look like for Oracle, Lotus or Microsoft, ten years from now. Gates is the best&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businessman I have ever run into and they have a hell of a position, but I really don’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>know what that business is going to look like ten years from now.&nbsp; I certainly don’t know&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>7&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what his competitors will look like ten years from now.&nbsp; I know what the chewing&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>business will look like ten years from now.&nbsp; The Internet is not going to change how we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>chew gum and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum.&nbsp; There will lots&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of new products.&nbsp; Is Spearmint or Juicy Fruit going to evaporate?&nbsp; It isn’t going to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>happen.&nbsp; You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into the chewing gum business&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and try to make a real dent in Wrigley’s.&nbsp; I can’t do it. That is how I think about&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businesses.&nbsp; I say to myself, give me a billion dollars and how much can I hurt the guy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Give me $10 billion dollars and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world?&nbsp; I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>can’t do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;are good businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Now give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>figure out how to do it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be ten (10) years&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>from now.&nbsp; If I can’t see where they will be ten years from now, I don’t want to buy it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Basically, I don’t want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>years, I won’t be happy owning it.&nbsp; I buy a farm and I don’t get a quote on it for five&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>years and I am happy if the farm does OK.&nbsp; I buy an apartment house and don’t get a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>quote on it for five years, I am happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>expect. People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>if they are doing well or not doing well.&nbsp; It is crazy.&nbsp; They are buying a piece of the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>business.&nbsp; That is what Graham—the most fundamental part of what he taught me.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>You are not buying a stock, you are buying part ownership in a business. You will do&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>well if the business does well, if you didn’t pay a totally silly price.&nbsp; That is what it is all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about.&nbsp; You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you buy farms, you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>ought to buy farms you understand.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not complicated.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Incidentally, by the way, in calling this Graham-Buffett, this is pure Graham.&nbsp; I was very&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>fortunate. I picked up his book (The Intelligent Investor</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;) when I was nineteen; I got&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>interested in stocks when I was 6 or 7.&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought my first stock when I was eleven. But I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>was playing around with all this stuff—I had charts and volume and I was making all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>types of technical calculations and everything.&nbsp; Then I picked up a little book that said&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you are not just buying some little ticker symbol, that bounces around every day, you are&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>buying part of a business.&nbsp; Soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>followed. It is very simple.&nbsp; So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>no one here who can’t understand Coke………….. (end of first side.)&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If I was teaching a class at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anybody that gave&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>me an answer, I’d flunk (Laughter).&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I don’t know how to do it.&nbsp; But people do it all the time; it is more exciting.&nbsp; If you look&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>at it like you are going to the races--that is a different thing--but if you are investing….&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more back later at an appropriate rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>8&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And to do that you have to understand what you are doing at any time. You have to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understand the business.&nbsp; You can understand some businesses but not all businesses.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: You covered half of it which is trying to understand a business and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>buying a business.&nbsp; You also alluded to getting a return on the amount of capital&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>invested in the business. How do you determine what is the proper price to pay for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the business?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; It is a tough thing to decide but I don’t want to buy into any business I am not&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>terribly sure of.&nbsp; So if I am terribly sure of it, it probably won’t offer incredible returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well, offer you 40% a year? We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>don’t have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind not losing anything.&nbsp; We bought&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>See’s Candy in 1972, See’s Candy was then selling 16 m. pounds of candy at a $1.95 a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>pound and it was making 2 bits a pound or $4 million pre-tax. We paid $25 million for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it—6.25 x pretax or about 10x after tax. It took no capital to speak of.&nbsp; &nbsp;When we looked&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>at that business—basically, my partner, Charlie, and I—we needed to decide if there was&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>some untapped pricing power</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;there.&nbsp; Where that $1.95 box of candy could sell for $2 to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>$2.25. If it could sell for $2.25 or another $0.30 per pound that was $4.8 on 16 million&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>pounds. Which on a $25 million purchase price was fine.&nbsp; We never hired a consultant in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>our lives; our idea of consulting was to go out and buy a box of candy and eat it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>What we did know was that they had share of mind in California.&nbsp; There was something&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>special. Every person in Ca. has something in mind about See’s Candy and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>overwhelmingly it was favorable.&nbsp; They had taken a box on Valentine’s Day to some girl&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and she had kissed him.&nbsp; If she slapped him, we would have no business. As long as she&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>kisses him, that is what we want in their minds. See’s Candy means getting kissed.&nbsp; If we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices.&nbsp; I bought it in 1972, and every&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>year I have raised prices on Dec. 26th, the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot on&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Christmas.&nbsp; In fact, we will make $60 million this year.&nbsp; We will make $2 per pound on&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>30 million pounds.&nbsp; Same business, same formulas, same everything--$60 million bucks&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and it still doesn’t take any capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And we make more money 10 years from now.&nbsp; But of that $60 million, we make $55&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>million in the three weeks before Christmas. And our company song is: “What a friend&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we have in Jesus.”&nbsp; (Laughter).&nbsp; It is a good business.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think about it a little.&nbsp; Most&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>people do not buy boxed chocolate to consume themselves, they buy them as gifts—</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;somebody’s birthday or more likely it is a holiday.&nbsp; Valentine’s Day is the single biggest&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>day of the year.&nbsp; Christmas is the biggest season by far.&nbsp; Women buy for Christmas and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>they plan ahead and buy over a two or three week period.&nbsp; &nbsp;Men buy on Valentine’s Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>They are driving home; we run ads on the Radio. Guilt, guilt, guilt—guys are veering off&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the highway right and left. They won’t dare go home without a box of Chocolates by the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>time we get through with them on our radio ads.&nbsp; So that Valentine’s Day is the biggest&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>day.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Can you imagine going home on Valentine’s Day—our See’s Candy is now $11 a pound&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>thanks to my brilliance.&nbsp; And let’s say there is candy available at $6 a pound.&nbsp; Do you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>9&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>really want to walk in on Valentine’s Day and hand—she has all these positive images of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>See’s Candy over the years—and say, “Honey, this year I took the low bid.” And hand&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>her a box of candy.&nbsp; It just isn’t going to work.&nbsp; &nbsp;So in a sense, there is untapped pricing&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>power</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;—it is not price dependent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Think of Disney.&nbsp; Disney is selling Home Videos for $16.95 or $18.95 or whatever. All&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>over the world—people, and we will speak particularly about Mothers in this case, have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something in their mind about Disney.&nbsp; Everyone in this room, when you say Disney, has&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something in their mind about Disney.&nbsp; When I say Universal Pictures, if I say 20th&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Century Fox, you don’t have anything special in your mind.&nbsp; Now if I say Disney, you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have something special in your mind.&nbsp; That is true around the world.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Now picture yourself with a couple of young kids, whom you want to put away for a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>couple of hours every day and get some peace of mind.&nbsp; You know if you get one video,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>they will watch it twenty times. So you go to the video store or wherever to buy the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>video.&nbsp; Are you going to sit there and premier 10 different videos and watch them each&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>for an hour and a half to decide which one your kid should watch?&nbsp; No. Let’s say there is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>one there for $16.95 and the Disney one for $17.95—you know if you take the Disney&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>video that you are going to be OK. So you buy it.&nbsp; You don’t have to make a quality&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>decision on something you don’t want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>more money if you are Disney and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;business.&nbsp; It makes it very tough for the other guy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>How would you try to create a brand—Dreamworks is trying—that competes with Disney&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>around the world and replaces the concept that people have in their minds about Disney&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>with something that says, Universal Pictures?&nbsp; So a mother is going to walk in and pick&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney.&nbsp; It is not going to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Coca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. Everyplace –&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Disneyland, the World Cup, the Olympics—where people are happy.&nbsp; Happiness and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Coke go together.&nbsp; Now you give me—I don’t care how much money—and tell me that I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>am going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people have a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>favorable image in their mind about RC Cola.&nbsp; You can’t get it done.&nbsp; You can fool&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>around, you can do what you want to do.&nbsp; You can have price discounts on weekends. But&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you are not going to touch it.&nbsp; That</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;is what you want to have in a business. That is the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>moat.&nbsp; You want that moat to widen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If you are See’s Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>experience basically of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction.&nbsp; It means what is in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the box, it means the person who sells it to you, because all of our business is done when&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we are terribly busy. People come in during theose weeks before Chirstmas, Valentine’s&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Day and there are long lines.&nbsp; So at five o’clock in the afternoon some woman is selling&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>someone the last box candy and that person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>customers.&nbsp; And if the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat has widened and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>if she snarls at ‘em, our moat has narrowed. We can’t see it, but it is going on everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But it is the key to it. It is the total part of the product delivery.&nbsp; It is having everything&nbsp;</font>
</p>

</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>associated with it say, See’s Candy and something pleasant happening.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is what&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>business is all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: If I have every bought a company where the numbers told me not to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>How much is quantitative and how much is qualitative?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to.&nbsp; Because then&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you feel so strongly about the product. And not just the fact you are getting a used cigar&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>butt cheap.&nbsp; Then it is compelling.&nbsp; I owned a windmill company at one time.&nbsp; Windmills&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it at a third of working&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>capital.&nbsp; And we made money out of it, but there is no repetitive</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;money to be made on it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>There is a one-time profit in something like that. And it is just not the thing to be doing.&nbsp; I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>went through that phase.&nbsp; I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things.&nbsp; In terms&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Almost every business we have bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We bought two businesses this year.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>General Re is a $18 billion deal.&nbsp; I have never been to their home office. I hope it is there.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>(Laughter) “There could be a few guys there saying what numbers should we send Buffett&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>this month?” I could see them going once a month and saying we have $20 billion in the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>bank instead of $18 billion.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never been there.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Before I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, before I bought it, I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>had never been there.&nbsp; I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>earlier. And I have seen the service and it seems to develop well. And I got the numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But if you don’t know enough to know about the business instantly, you won’t know&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>enough in a month or in two months.&nbsp; You have to have sort of the background of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understanding and knowing what you do or don’t understand. That is the key.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>defining your circle of competence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Everybody has got a different circle of competence.&nbsp; The important thing is not how big&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the circle is, the important thing is the size of the circle; the important thing is staying&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>inside the circle</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;.&nbsp; And if that circle only has 30 companies in it out of 1000s on the big&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you will be OK.&nbsp; And you should know&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>those businesses well enough so you don’t need to read lots of work.&nbsp; Now I did a lot of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>work in the earlier years just getting familiar with businesses and the way I would do that&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>is use what Phil Fisher would call, the “Scuttlebutt Approach.”&nbsp; I would go out and talk&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>to customers, suppliers, and maybe ex-employees in some cases.&nbsp; Everybody.&nbsp; Everytime&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I was interested in an industry, say it was coal, I would go around and see every coal&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>company.&nbsp; I would ask every CEO, “If you could only buy stock in one coal company&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that was not your own, which one would it be and why?&nbsp; You piece those things together,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you learn about the business after awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Funny, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors.&nbsp; If you had a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>silver bullet and you could put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and why?&nbsp; You will find who the best guy is in the industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;So there are a lot of things&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>11&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you can learn about a business.&nbsp; I have done that in the past on the business I felt I could&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understand so I don’t have to do that anymore.&nbsp; The nice thing about investing is that you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>don’t have to learn anything new.&nbsp; You can do it if you want to, but if you learn Wrigley’s&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>chewing gum forty years ago, you still understand Wrigley’s chewing gum.&nbsp; There are not&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a lot of great insights to get of the sort as you go along.&nbsp; So you do get a database in your&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years; his father-in-law died and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company.&nbsp; And he put it up with Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; But he&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and he mentioned it to this friend,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>so my friend said “Why don’t you call Warren?”&nbsp; He called me after the match and in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>five minutes I basically had a deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But I knew Frank, and I knew the business.&nbsp; I sort of knew the basic economics of the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>shoe business, so I could buy it.&nbsp; Quantitatively, I have to decide what the price is.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you know, that is either yes or no.&nbsp; I don’t fool a lot around with negotiations.&nbsp; If they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it.&nbsp; If they don’t, I was happy the day before,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>so I will be happy the day after without owning it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: The Asian Crisis and how it affects a company like Coke that recently&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>announced their earnings would be lower in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: Well, basically I love it, but because the market for Coca-Cola products will&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>grow far faster over the next twenty years internationally than it will in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>It will grow in the U.S. on a per capita basis.&nbsp; The fact that it will be a tough period for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>who knows—three months or three years—but it won’t be tough for twenty years. People&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will still be going to be working productively around the world and they are going to find&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>this is a bargain product in terms of a portion of their working day that they have to give&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>up in order to have one of these, better yet, five of them a day like I do.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>This is a product that in 1936 when I first bought 6 of those for a quarter and sold them&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>for a nickel each.&nbsp; It was in a 6.5 oz bottle and you paid a two cents deposit on the bottle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>That was a 6.5 oz. bottle for a nickel at that time; it is now a 12 oz. can which if you buy&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it on Weekends or if you buy it in bigger quantities, so much money doesn’t go to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>packaging—you essentially can buy the 12 ozs. for not much more than 20 cents. So you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are paying not much more than twice the per oz. price of 1936.&nbsp; This is a product that has&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>gotten cheaper and cheaper relative to people’s earning power over the years. And which&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>people love. And in 200 countries, you have the per capita consumption use going up&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>every year for a product that is over 100 years old that dominates the market.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>unbelievable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>One thing that people don’t understand is one thing that makes this product worth 10s&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and 10s of billions of dollars is one simple fact about really all colas, but we will call it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Coca-Cola for the moment.&nbsp; It happens to be a name that I like.&nbsp; Cola has no taste&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>memory.&nbsp; You can drink one of these at 9 O’clock, 10 O’clock, 1 O’clock and 5 O’clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The one at 5 o’clock will taste as good to you as the one you drank early in the morning,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>12&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you can’t do that with Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange, Grape.&nbsp; All of those things&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>accumulate on you.&nbsp; Most foods and beverages accumulate; you get sick of them after a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>while. And if you eat See’s Candy—we get these people who go to work for us at See’s&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Candy and the first day they go crazy, but after a week they are eating the same amount&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>as if they were buying it, because chocolate accumulates on you.&nbsp; There is no taste&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>memory to Cola and that means you get people around the world who will be heavy&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>users—who will drink five a day, or for Diet Coke, 7 or even 8 a day. They will never do&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that with other products.&nbsp; So you get this incredible per capita consumption.&nbsp; The average&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>person in this part of the world or maybe a little north of here drinks 64 ozs. of liquid a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>day.&nbsp; You can have 64 ozs. of that be Coke and you will not get fed up with Coke if you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>like it to start with in the least. But if you do that with anything else; if you eat just one&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>product all day, you will get a little sick of it after a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>It is a huge factor.&nbsp; So today over 1 billion of Coca-Cola product servings will be sold in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the world and that will grow year by year.&nbsp; It will grow in every country virtually, and it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will grow on a per capita basis. And twenty years from now it will grow a lot faster&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>internationally than in the U.S., so I really like that market better, because there is more&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>growth there over time. But it will hurt them in the short term right now, but that doesn’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>mean anything. Coca-Cola went public in 1919; the stock sold for $40 per share.&nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Chandler family bought the whole business for $2,000 back in the late 1880s.&nbsp; So now he&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>goes public in 1919, $40 per share.&nbsp; One year later it is selling for $19 per share. It has&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>gone down 50% in one year.&nbsp; You might think it is some kind of disaster and you might&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>think sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious. And a whole bunch of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>things.&nbsp; You can always find reasons that weren't the ideal moment to buy it.&nbsp; Years later&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you would have seen the Great Depression, WW II and sugar rationing and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>thermonuclear weapons and the whole thing—there is always a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But in the end if you had bought one share at $40 per share and reinvested the dividends,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it would be worth $5 million now ($40 compounding at 14.63% for 86 years!).&nbsp; That&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>factor so overrides anything else.&nbsp; If you are right about the business you will make a lot&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of money.&nbsp; The timing part of it is very tricky thing so I don’t worry about any given&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>event if I got a wonderful business what it does next year or something of the sort.&nbsp; Price&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>controls have been in this country at various times and that has fouled up even the best of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businesses.&nbsp; I wouldn’t be able to raise prices Dec 31st on See’s Candy. But that doesn’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>make it a lousy business if that happens to happen, because you are not going to have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>price controls forever.&nbsp; We had price controls in the early 70s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The wonderful business—you can figure what will happen, you can’t figure out when it&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will happen. You don’t want to focus too much on when but you want to focus on what.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If you are right about what, you don’t have to worry about when very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: What about your business mistakes?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: How much time do you have? The interesting thing about investments for me&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and my partner, Charlie Munger, the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>commission, but of omission. They are where we knew enough about the business to do&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>13&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something and where, for one reason or another, sat they're sucking out thumbs instead of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>doing something. And so we have passed up things where we could have made billions&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and billions of dollars from things we understood, forget about things we don’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understand.&nbsp; The fact I could have made billions of dollars from Microsoft doesn’t mean&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>anything because I never could understand Microsoft. But if I can make billions out of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>healthcare stocks, then I should make it. And I didn’t when the Clinton health care&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>program was proposed and they all went in the tank.&nbsp; We should have made a ton of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>money out of that because I could understand it.&nbsp; And didn’t make it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back the mid-1980s, but I didn’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>do it.&nbsp; Those are billion dollar mistakes or multi-billion dollar mistakes that generally&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>accepted accounting principles don’t pick up.&nbsp; The mistakes you see.&nbsp; I made a mistake&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>when I bought US Air Preferred some years ago.&nbsp; I had a lot of money around.&nbsp; I make&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead. Don’t hang around the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>office.&nbsp; But I hang around the office and I have money in my pocket, I do something&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>dumb. It happens every time.&nbsp; So I bought this thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nobody made me buy it.&nbsp; I now&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline.&nbsp; I say, “I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>am Warren and I am an air-aholic.”&nbsp; They try to talk me down, “Keep talking don’t do&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>anything rash.” Finally I got over it.&nbsp; But I bought it.&nbsp; And it looked like we would lose&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>all our money in it. And we came very close to losing all our money in it.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can say&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we deserved to lose our money it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We bought it because it was an attractive security.&nbsp; But it was not in an attractive&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>industry.&nbsp; I did the same thing in Salomon.&nbsp; I bought an attractive security in a business I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>wouldn’t have bought the equity in.&nbsp; So you could say that is one form of mistake.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buying something because you like the terms, but you don’t like the business that well.&nbsp; I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have done that in the past and will probably do that again.&nbsp; &nbsp;The bigger mistakes are the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>ones of omission.&nbsp; Back when I had $10,000 I put $2,000 of it into a Sinclair Service&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Station which I lost, so the opportunity cost on that money is about $6 billion right now--&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>fairly big mistakes.&nbsp; It makes me feel good when my Berkshire goes down, because the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>cost of my Sinclair Station goes down too.&nbsp; My 20% opportunity cost.&nbsp; I will say this, it is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>better to learn from other people’s mistakes as much as possible.&nbsp; But we don’t spend any&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>time looking back at Berkshire.&nbsp; I have a partner, Charlie Munger; we have been pals for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>forty years—never had an argument.&nbsp; We disagree on things a lot but we don’t have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>arguments about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We never look back.&nbsp; We just figure there is so much to look forward to that there is no&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>sense thinking of what we might have done. It just doesn’t make any difference.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>only live life forward.&nbsp; You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>thing to do is to stick with the businesses you understand.&nbsp; &nbsp; So if there is a generic&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>mistake outside your circle of competence like buying something that somebody tips you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>on or something of the sort. In an area you know nothing about, you should learn&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something from that which is to stay with what you can figure out yourself.&nbsp; You really&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>want your decision making to be by looking in the mirror.&nbsp; Saying to yourself, “I am&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>buying 100 shares of General Motors at $55 because……..”&nbsp; It is your responsibility if&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you are buying it. There’s gotta be a reason and if you can’t state the reason, you&nbsp;</font>

</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>shouldn’t buy it.&nbsp; If it is because someone told you about it at a cocktail party, not good&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;It can’t be because of the volume or a reason like the chart looks good.&nbsp; It has to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>be a reason to buy the business.&nbsp; That we stick to pretty carefully.&nbsp; That is one of the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>things Ben Graham taught me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: The current tenuous economic situation and interest rates?&nbsp; Where are we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>going?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: I don’t think about the macro stuff.&nbsp; What you really want to in investments is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>figure out what is important and knowable</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If it is unimportant and unknowable, you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>forget about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;What you talk about is important but, in my view, it is not knowable.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Understanding Coca-Cola is knowable or Wrigley’s or Eastman Kodak. You can&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understand those businesses that are knowable.&nbsp; Whether it turns out to be important&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>depends where your valuation leads you and the firm’s price and all that.&nbsp; But we have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>never not bought or bought a business because of any Macro feeling of any kind because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it doesn’t make any difference.&nbsp; Let’s say in 1972 when we bought See’s Candy, I think&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Nixon put on the price controls a little bit later, but so what! We would have missed a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>chance to buy something for $25 million that is producing $60 million pre-tax now.&nbsp; We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>don’t want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some prediction&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about something we are no good on anyway.&nbsp; So we don’t read or listen to in relation to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>macro factors at all.&nbsp; The typical investment counselor organization goes out and they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>bring out their economist and they trot him out and he gives you this big macro picture.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And they start working from there on down.&nbsp; In our view that is nonsense.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If Alan Greenspan was on the one side of me and Robert Rubin on the other side and they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>both were whispering in my ear exactly what they were going to do the next twelve&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>months, it wouldn’t make any difference to me what I would pay for Executive Jet or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>General Re or anything else I do.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question:&nbsp; What is the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being on&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Wall Street?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: I worked on Wall Street for a couple of years and I have my best friends on both&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>coasts.&nbsp; I like seeing them. I get ideas when I go there.&nbsp; But the best way to think about&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>investments is to be in a room with no one else and just think.&nbsp; And if that doesn’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>work, nothing else is going to work. The disadvantage of being in any type of market&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>environment like Wall Street in the extreme is that you get over-stimulated.&nbsp; You think&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you have to do something every day.&nbsp; The Chandler family paid $2,000 for this company&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>(Coke). You don’t have to do much else if you pick one of those.&nbsp; And the trick then is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>not</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;to do anything else. Even not to sell at 1919, which the family did later on.&nbsp; So what&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you are looking for is some way to get one good idea a year.&nbsp; And then ride it to its full&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>potential and that is very hard to do in an environment where people are shouting prices&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>back and forth every five minutes and shoving reports in front of your nose and all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Wall Street makes its money on activity.&nbsp; You make your money on inactivity.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;15&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If everyone in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you will all end up broke. And the intermediary will end up with all the money. If you all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>own stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke.&nbsp; He is like the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Doctor who gets paid on how often to get you to change pills. If he gave you one pill that&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>cures you the rest of your life, he would make one sale, one transaction and that is it. But&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it will be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>great for him and the prescriptionists.&nbsp; You won’t be any healthier and you will be a lot&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>worse off financially.&nbsp; &nbsp;You want to stay away from any environment that stimulates&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>activity.&nbsp; &nbsp;And Wall Street would have the effective of doing that.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>When I went back to Omaha, I would go back with a whole list of companies I wanted to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>check out and I would get my money’s worth out of those trips, but then I would go back&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>to Omaha and think about it.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: How to evaluate Berkshire or MSFT if it does not pay dividends?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: It won’t pay any dividends either.&nbsp; That is a promise I can keep.&nbsp; All you get&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>with Berkshire, you stick it in your safe deposit box and then every year you go down and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>fondle it.&nbsp; &nbsp;You take it out and then you put it back.&nbsp; There is enormous psychic reward in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don’t underestimate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The real question is if we can retain dollar bills and turn them into more than a dollar at a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>decent rate.&nbsp; That is what we try to do.&nbsp; And Charlie Munger and I have all our money in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it to do that.&nbsp; That is all we will get paid for doing.&nbsp; We won’t take any options or we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>won’t take any salaries to speak of.&nbsp; But that is what we are trying to do.&nbsp; It gets harder all&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;The more money we manage the harder it is to do that.&nbsp; &nbsp;We would do way&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>better percentage wise with Berkshire if it was 1/100th the present size.&nbsp; It is run for its&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>owners, but it isn’t run to give them dividends because so far every dollar that we earned&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>or could have paid out, we have turned into more than a dollar.&nbsp; It is worth more than a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>dollar to keep it.&nbsp; Therefore, it would be silly to pay it out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if everyone was tax</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>free that owned it. It would have been a mistake to pay dividends at Berkshire. Because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>so far the dollar bills retained have turned into more than a dollar.&nbsp; &nbsp;But there is no&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>guarantee that happens in the future.&nbsp; At some point the game runs out on that.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what the business is about.&nbsp; Nothing else about the business do we judge ourselves by.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We don’t judge it by the size of its home office building or anything the like the number&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of people working there.&nbsp; We have 12 people working at headquarters and 45,000&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>employees at Berkshire, 12 people at HQ and 3,500 sq ft. and we won’t change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>But we will judge ourselves by the performance of the company and that is the only way&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we will get paid.&nbsp; But believe me, it is a lot harder than it used to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: What tells you when an investment has reached its full potential?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: I don’t buy Coke with the idea it will be out of gas in 10 years or 50 years. There&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>could be something that happens by I think the chances are almost nil.&nbsp; &nbsp;So what we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>16&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>really want to do is buy businesses that we would be happy to own forever.&nbsp; It is the same&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>way I fell about people who buy Berkshire.&nbsp; I want people who buy Berkshire to plan to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>hold it forever.&nbsp; They may not for one reason or the other but I want them at the time they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>buy it to think they are buying a business they are going to want to own forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And I don’t say that is the only way to buy things.&nbsp; It is just the group to join me because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I don’t want to have a changing group all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I measure Berkshire by how little&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>activity there is in it.&nbsp; If I had a church and I was the preacher and half the congregation&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>left every Sunday.&nbsp; I wouldn’t say, “It is marvelous to have all this liquidity among my&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>members.”&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Terrific turnover… I would rather go to church where all the seats are filled every&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Sunday by the same people.&nbsp; Well that is the way we look at the businesses we buy.&nbsp; We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>want to buy something virtually forever.&nbsp; And we can’t find a lot of those. And back&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>when I started, I had way more ideas than money so I was just constantly having to sell&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what was the least attractive stock in order to buy something I just discovered that looked&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>even cheaper.&nbsp; But that is not our problem really now.&nbsp; So we hope we are buying&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businesses that we are just as happy holding five years from now as now.&nbsp; And if we ever&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>found a huge acquisition, then maybe we would have to sell something. Maybe to make&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that acquisition but that would be a very pleasant problem to have.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We never buy something with a price target in mind.&nbsp; We never buy something at 30&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>saying if it goes to 40 we’ll sell it or 50 or 60 or 100.&nbsp; &nbsp;We just don’t do it that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Anymore than when we buy a private business like See’s Candy for $25 million.&nbsp; We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>don’t ever say if we ever get an offer of $50 million for this business we will sell it.&nbsp; That&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>is not the way to look at a business.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The way to look at a business is this going to keep producing more and more money over&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>time? And if the answer to that is yes, you don’t need to ask any more questions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Questions: How did you decide to invest in Salomon?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: Salomon like I said, I went into that because it was a 9% security in 1987 in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>September 1987 and the Dow was up 35% and we sold a lot of stuff.&nbsp; And I had a lot of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>money around and it looked to me like we would never get to do anything, so I took an&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of. I went in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>because of that and I think generally it is a mistake.&nbsp; It worked out OK finally on that. But&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it is not what I should have been doing.&nbsp; I either should have waited in which case I could&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have bought more Coca-Cola a year later or thereabouts or I should have even bought&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Coke at the prices it was selling at even though it was selling at a pretty good price at the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>time.&nbsp; So that was a mistake.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>On Long-Term Capital that is—we have owned other businesses associated with&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>securities over the years-–One of them is arbitrage.&nbsp; I’ve done arbitrage for 45 years and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Graham did it for 30 years before that.&nbsp; That is a business unfortunately I have to be near&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a phone for.&nbsp; I have to really run it (arbitrage operations) out of the office myself, because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>17&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it requires being more market-attuned because I don’t want to do that anymore.&nbsp; So unless&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a really big arbitrage situation came along that I understood, I won’t be doing much of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that.&nbsp; But I’ve probably participated in about 300 arbitrage situations at least in my life&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>maybe more.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a good business, a perfectly good business.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>LTCM has a bunch of positions, they have tons of positions, but the top ten are probably&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>90% of the money that is at risk, and I know something about those ten positions.&nbsp; I don’t&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>know everything about them by a long shot, but I know enough that I would feel OK at a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>big discount going in and we had the staying power to hold it out.&nbsp; We might lose money&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>on something on that, but the odds are with us.&nbsp; That is a game that I understand.&nbsp; There&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are few other positions we have that are not that big because they can’t get that big.&nbsp; But&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>they could involve yield curve relationships or on the run/off the run governments that&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are just things you learn over time being around securities markets. They are not the base&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of our business. Probably on average, they have accounted for ½ - ¾ a percentage point&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of our return a year. They are little pluses you get for actually having been around a long&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Arbitrage</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;One of the first arbitrages I did involved a company that offered cocoa beans in exchange&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>for their stock.&nbsp; That was in 1955.&nbsp; I bought the stock, turned in the stock, got warehouse&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>certificates for cocoa beans and they happen to be a different type but there was a basis&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>differential and I sold them.&nbsp; That was something I was around at the time, so I learned&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about it.&nbsp; There hasn’t been a cocoa deal since. 40 odd years, I have been waiting for a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>cocoa deal. I haven’t seen it.&nbsp; It is there in my memory if it ever comes along.&nbsp; LTCM is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that on a big scale.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: Diversification?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: The question is about diversification.&nbsp; I have a dual answer to that. If you are not&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a professional investor.&nbsp; If your goal is not to manage money to earn a significantly better&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>return than the world, then I believe in extreme diversification.&nbsp; I believe 98% - 99% who&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>invest should extensively diversify and not trade, so that leads them to an index fund type&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of decision with very low costs.&nbsp; All they are going to do is own part of America. And&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>they have made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don’t quarrel&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>with that at all.&nbsp; That is the way they should approach it unless they want to bring an&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>intensity to the game to make a decision and start evaluating businesses. Once you are in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the businesses of evaluating businesses and you decide that you are going to bring the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>effort and intensity and time involved to get that job done, then I think diversification is a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>terrible mistake to any degree.&nbsp; I got asked that question the other day at SunTrust.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>really know businesses, you probably shouldn’t own more than six of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you will make a lot of money.&nbsp; And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of putting more money into your first one is gotta be a terrible mistake. Very few people&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>18&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>best idea.&nbsp; So I would say for anyone working with normal capital who really knows the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>businesses they have gone into, six is plenty, and I probably have half of what I like best.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I don’t diversify personally.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp; All the people I’ve known that have done well with the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>exception of Walter Schloss, Walter diversifies a lot. I call him Noah, he has two of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: How do you distinguish the Cokes of the world from the Proctor &amp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Gambles of this world?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; Well, P&amp;G is a very, very good business with strong distribution capability and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>lots of brand names, but if you ask me and I am going to go away for twenty years and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>put all my family’s net worth into one business,&nbsp; would I rather have P&amp;G or Coke?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Actually P&amp;G is more diversified among product line, but I would feel more sure of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Coke than P&amp;G.&nbsp; I wouldn’t be unhappy if someone told me I had to own P&amp;G during&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the twenty-year period.&nbsp; I mean that would be in my top 5 percent. Because they are not&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>going to get killed, but I would feel better about the unit growth and pricing power of a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Coke over twenty or thirty years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Right now the pricing power might be tough, but you think a billion servings a day for a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>penny each or $10 million per day.&nbsp; We own 8% of that, so that is $800,000 per day for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Berkshire Hathaway.&nbsp; You could get another penny out of the stuff.&nbsp; It doesn’t seem&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>impossible.&nbsp; I think it is worth a penny more.&nbsp; Right now it would be a mistake to try and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>get it in most markets. But over time, Coke will make more per serving than it does now.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Twenty years from now I guarantee they will make more per serving, and they will be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>selling a whole lot more servings.&nbsp; I don't know how many or how much more, but I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>know that.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>P&amp;G's main products--I don't think they have the kind of dominance, and they don't have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the kind of unit growth, but they are good businesses.&nbsp; I would not be unhappy if you told&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>me that I had to put my family's net worth into P&amp;G and that was the only stock I would&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>own.&nbsp; I might prefer some other name, but there are not 100 other names I would prefer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: Would you buy McDonald’s and go away for twenty years?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: McDonald’s has a lot of things going for it, particularly abroad again.&nbsp; Thee&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>position abroad in many countries is stronger than it is here. It is a tougher business over&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>time.&nbsp; People don't want to be eating--exception to the kids when they are giving away&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>beanie babies or something--at McDonald’s every day. If people drink five Cokes a day,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>they probably will drink five of them tomorrow. The fast food business is tougher than&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that but if you had to pick one hand to have in the fast food business, which is going to be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a huge business worldwide, you would pick McDonald’s.&nbsp; I mean it has the strongest&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>It doesn't win taste test with adults. It does very well with children and it does fine with&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>adults, but it is not like it is a clear winner. And it is gotten into the game in recent years&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of being more price promotional--you remember the experiment a year ago or so.&nbsp; It has&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>19&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>gotten more dependent on that rather than selling the product by itself.&nbsp; I like the product&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>by itself.&nbsp; I feel better about Gillette if people buy the Mach 3 because they like the Mach&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>3 than if they get a Beanie Baby with it.&nbsp; So I think fundamentally it is a stronger product&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>if that is the case.&nbsp; And that is probably the case.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>We own a lot of Gillette and you can sleep pretty well at night if you think of a couple&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>billion men with their hair growing on their faces.&nbsp; It is growing all night while you sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Women have two legs, it is even better.&nbsp; So it beats counting sheep. And those are the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>kinds of business…(you look for).&nbsp; But what type of promotion am I going to put out&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>there against Burger King next month or what if they sign up Disney and I don't get&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Disney?&nbsp; I like the products that stand alone absent price promotion or appeals although&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you can build a very good business based on that. And McDonald’s is a terrific business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>It is not as good a business as Coke. There really hardly are any. It is a very good&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>business and if you bet on one company in that field bet on (garbled) McDonald’s.&nbsp; We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>bought Dairy Queen a while back that is why I am plugging it shamelessly here.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: What do I think about the utility industry?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: I have thought about that a lot because you can put big money in it.&nbsp; I have even&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>thought of buying the entire businesses. There is a fellow in Omaha actually that has done&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a little of that through Cal Energy.&nbsp; But I don't quite understand the game in terms of how&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it is going to develop with deregulation.&nbsp; I can see how it destroys a lot of value through&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the high cost producer once they are not protected by a monopoly territory.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I don't for sure see who benefits and how much. Obviously the guy with very low cost&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>power or some guy has hydro-power at two cents a KwH has a huge advantage. But how&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>much of that he gets to keep or how extensively he can send that outside his natural&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>territory, I haven't been able to figure that out so I really know what the Industry will&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>look like in ten years. But it is something I think about and if I ever develop any insights&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that call for action, I will act on them. Because I think I can understand the attractiveness&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>of the product.&nbsp; All the aspects of certainty of users need and the fact it is a bargain and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>all of that.&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp; I don't understand who is going to make the money in ten years.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>And that keeps me away.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question: Why do large caps outperform small caps (1998)?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett:&nbsp; We don't care if a company is large cap, small cap, middle cap, micro cap.&nbsp; It&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>doesn't make any difference.&nbsp; The only questions that matter to us:&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>• Do we understand the business?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>• Do we like the people running it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>• And does it sell for a price that is attractive?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>From my personal standpoint running Berkshire now because we got, pro forma for Gen.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Re, $75 to $80 billion to invest in and I only want to invest in five things, so I am really&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>limited to very big companies.&nbsp; But if I were investing $100,000, I wouldn't care whether&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>20&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something was large cap or small cap or anything.&nbsp; I would just look for businesses I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Now, I think, on balance, large cap companies as businesses have done extraordinarily&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>well the last ten years--way better than people anticipated they would do.&nbsp; You really&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. And that is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>something nobody dreamed of and that is being produced by very large companies in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>aggregate.&nbsp; So you have had this huge revaluation upwards because of lower interest rates&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and much higher returns on capital. If America business is really a disguised bond that&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>earns 20%, a 20% coupon it is much better than a bond with a 13% coupon. And that has&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>happened with big companies in recent years, whether it is permanent or not is another&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>question.&nbsp; I am skeptical of that.&nbsp; I wouldn't even think about it--except for questions of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>how much money we run--I wouldn't even think about the size of the business.&nbsp; See's&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Candy was a $25 million business when we bought it.&nbsp; If I can find one now, as big as we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are, I would love to buy it. It is the certainty</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;of it that counts.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question:&nbsp; The securitization of real estate?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: There has been enormous securitization of the debt too of real estate and that is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>one of the items right now that is really clogging up the capital markets. The mortgage&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>back securities are just not moving, commercial, not residential mortgage backs.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>think you are directing your question at equities probably.&nbsp; The equities, if you leave out&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>the corporate form, have been a lousy way to own equities. You have interjected a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>corporate income tax into something that people individually have been able to own with&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a single tax, and to have the normal corporate form you have a double taxation in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>You really don't need it and it takes too much of the return.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>REITS have, in effect, created a conduit so you don't get the double taxation, but they&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>also generally have fairly high operating expenses.&nbsp; If you get real estate, let's just say&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you can buy fairly simple types of real estate at an 8% yield, or thereabouts, and you take&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>away close to 1% to 1.5% by the time you count stock options and everything, it is not a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>terribly attractive way to own real estate. Maybe the only way a guy with a $1,000 or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>$5,000 can own it but if you have $1 million or $10 million, you are better off owning the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>real estate properties yourself instead of sticking some intermediary in between who will&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>get a sizable piece of the return for himself.&nbsp; So we have found very little in that field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>You will see an announcement in the next couple of weeks that may belie what I am&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>telling you today.&nbsp; I don't want you to think I am double crossing you up here.&nbsp; But&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>generally speaking we have seen very little in that field that gets us excited.&nbsp; People&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>sometimes get very confused about--they will look at some huge land company, like&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around over 100 years and has got a couple of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>million acres in Texas.&nbsp; And they will sell 1% of their land every year and they will take&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that (as income? Garbled) and come up with some huge value compared to the market&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>value. But that is nonsense if you really own the property.&nbsp; You can't move.&nbsp; You can't&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>move 50% of the properties or 20% of the properties, it is way worse than an illiquid&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>stock.&nbsp; So you get these, I think, you get some very silly valuations placed on a lot of real&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>21&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>estate companies by people who really don't understand what it is like to own one and try&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>to move large quantity of properties.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>REITS have behaved horribly in this market as you know and it is not at all inconceivable&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that they become a class that would get so unpopular that they would sell at significant&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>discounts from what you could sell the properties for.&nbsp; And they could get interesting as a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>class and then the question is whether management would fight you in that process&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>because they would be giving up their income stream for managing things and their&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>interests might run counter to the shareholders on that.&nbsp; I have always wondered about&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>REITS that have managements they say their assets are so wonderful, and they are so&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>cheap and then they (management) go out and sell stock.&nbsp; There is a contradiction in that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>They say our stock is very cheap at $28 and then they sell a lot of stock at $28 less an&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>underwriting commission.&nbsp; There is a disconnect there. But it is a field we look at.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Charlie and I can understand real estate, and we would be open for very big transactions&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>periodically.&nbsp; If there was a LTCM situation translated to real estate, we would be open to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that, the trouble is so many other people would be too that it would unlikely go at a price&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that would get us really get us excited.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question:&nbsp; A down market is good for you?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: I have no idea were the market is going to go.&nbsp; I prefer it going down.&nbsp; But my&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>preferences have nothing to do with it. The market knows nothing about my feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>That is one of the first things you have to learn about a stock. You buy 100 shares of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>General Motors (GM).&nbsp; Now all of a sudden you have this feeling about GM.&nbsp; It goes&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>down, you may be mad at it.&nbsp; You may say, "Well, if it just goes up for what I paid for it,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>my life will be wonderful again."&nbsp; Or if it goes up, you may say how smart you were and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>how you and GM have this love affair. You have got all these feelings.&nbsp; The stock doesn't&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>know you own it</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The stock just sits there; it doesn't care what you paid or the fact that you own it. Any&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>feeling I have about the market is not reciprocated.&nbsp; I mean it is the ultimate cold shoulder&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>we are talking about here.&nbsp; Practically anybody in this room is probably more likely to be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>a net buyer of stocks over the next ten years than they are a net seller, so everyone of you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>should prefer lower prices.&nbsp; If you are a net eater of hamburger over the next ten years,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>you want hamburger to go down unless you are a cattle producer.&nbsp; If you are going to be a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>buyer of Coca-Cola and you don't own Coke stock, you hope the price of Coke goes&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>down.&nbsp; You are looking for it to be on sale this weekend at your Supermarket. You want&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>it to be down on the weekends not up on the weekends when you tend the Supermarket.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>The NYSE is one big supermarket of companies.&nbsp; And you are going to be buying stocks,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what you want to have happen?&nbsp; &nbsp;You want to have those stocks go down, way down; you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will make better buys then.&nbsp; Later on twenty or thirty years from now when you are in a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>period when you are dis-saving, or when your heirs dis-save for you,&nbsp; then you may care&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>about higher prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is Chapter 8 in Graham's Intelligent Investor</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>&nbsp;about the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>attitude toward stock market fluctuations, that and Chapter 20 on the Margin of Safety&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>22&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>are the two most important essays ever written on investing as far as I am concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Because when I read Chapter 8 when I was 19, I figured out what I just said but it is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>obvious, but I didn't figure it out myself. It was explained to me.&nbsp; I probably would have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>gone another 100 years and still thought it was good when my stocks were going up.&nbsp; We&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>want things to go down, but I have no idea what the stock market is going to do.&nbsp; I never&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>do and I never will. It is not something I think about at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>When it goes down, I look harder at what I might buy that day because I know there is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>more likely to be some merchandise there to use my money effectively in.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Moderator: Ok, Warren, we will let you take one more question from the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>audience….&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: I will let you pick who get it.&nbsp; You can be the guy…(laughter).&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Question:&nbsp; What would you do to live a happier life if you could live over again?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Buffett: This will sound disgusting.&nbsp; The question is how would I live my life over again&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>to live a happier life?&nbsp; The only thing would be to select a gene pool where people lived&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>to 120 or something where I came from.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I have been extraordinarily lucky.&nbsp; I mean, I use this example and I will take a minute or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>two because I think it is worth thinking about a little bit.&nbsp; Let's just assume it was 24&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>hours before you were born and a genie came to you and he said, "Herb, you look very&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>promising and I have a big problem.&nbsp; I got to design the world in which you are going to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>live in.&nbsp; I have decided it is too tough; you design it. So you have twenty-four hours, you&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>figure out what the social rules should be, the economic rules and the governmental rules&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and you and your kids and their kids will live under those rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>You say, "I can design anything?&nbsp; There must be a catch?"&nbsp; The genie says there is a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>catch.&nbsp; You don't know if you are going to be born black or white, rich or poor, male or&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>female, infirm or able-bodied, bright or retarded.&nbsp; All you know is you are going to take&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>one ball out of a barrel with 5.8 billion (balls).&nbsp; &nbsp;You are going to participate in the&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>ovarian lottery.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that is going to be the most important thing in your life, because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that is going to control whether you are born here or in Afghanistan or whether you are&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>born with an IQ of 130 or an IQ of 70. It is going to determine a whole lot.&nbsp; &nbsp;What type of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>world are you going to design?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>I think it is a good way to look at social questions, because not knowing which ball you&nbsp;</font>

<p>
    <font>are going to get, you are going to want to design a system that is going to provide lots of&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>goods and services because you want people on balance to live well. And you want it to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>produce more and more so your kids live better than you do and your grandchildren live&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>better than their parents.&nbsp; But you also want a system that does produce lots of goods and&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>services that does not leave behind a person who accidentally got the wrong ball and is&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>not well wired for this particular system.&nbsp; I am ideally wired for the system I fell into&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>here. I came out and got into something that enables me to allocate capital.&nbsp; Nothing so&nbsp;</font>

<p>
    <font>Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>wonderful about that.&nbsp; If all of us were stranded on a desert island somewhere and we&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>were never going to get off of it, the most valuable person there would be the one who&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>could raise the most rice over time.&nbsp; I can say, "I can allocate capital!"&nbsp; You wouldn't be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>very excited about that.&nbsp; So I have been born in the right place.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Gates says that if I had been born three million years ago, I would have been some&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>animal's lunch.&nbsp; &nbsp;He says, "You can't run very fast, you can't climb trees, you can't do&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>anything."&nbsp; You would just be chewed up the first day.&nbsp; You are lucky; you were born&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>today.&nbsp; And I am.&nbsp; The question getting back, here is this barrel with 6.5 billion balls,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>everybody in the world, if you could put your ball back, and they took out at random a&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>100 balls and you had to pick one of those, would you put your ball back in?&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Now those 100 balls you are going to get out, roughly 5 of them will be American, 95/5.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>So if you want to be in this country, you will only have 5 balls, half of them will be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>women and half men--I will let you decide how you will vote on that one.&nbsp; Half of them&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>will below average in intelligence and half above average in intelligence.&nbsp; Do you want to&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>put your ball in there?&nbsp; Most of you will not want to put your ball back to get 100.&nbsp; &nbsp;So&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>what you are saying is: I am in the luckiest one percent of the world right now sitting in&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>this room--the top one percent of the world.&nbsp; Well, that is the way I feel.&nbsp; I am lucky to be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>born where I was because it was 50 to 1 in the United States when I was born. I have&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>been lucky with parents, lucky with all kinds of things and lucky to be wired in a way&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>that in a market economy, pays off like crazy for me.&nbsp; It doesn't pay off as well for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>someone who is absolutely as good a citizen as I am (by) leading Boy Scout troops,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>teaching Sunday School or whatever, raising fine families, but just doesn't happen to be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>wired in the same way that I am.&nbsp; So I have been extremely lucky so I would like to be&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>lucky again.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>Then the way to do it is to play out the game and do something you enjoy all your life&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>and be associated with people you like.&nbsp; I only work with people I like.&nbsp; If I could make&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>$100 million dollars with a guy who causes my stomach to churn, I would say no because&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>in way that is very much like marrying for money which is probably not a very good idea&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>in any circumstances, but if you are already rich, it is crazy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not going to marry for&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font>money.&nbsp; I would really do almost exactly what I have done except I wouldn't have bought&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p>
    <font>Thank you.&nbsp;</font>
