<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was 37 then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through&nbsp;</p>
<p>dense cloud cover on approach to Hamburg airport. Cold November&nbsp;</p>
<p>rains drenched the earth, lending everything the gloomy air of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flemish landscape: the ground crew in waterproofs, a flag atop a squat&nbsp;</p>
<p>airport building, a BMW billboard. So - Germany again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the plane was on the ground, soft music began to flow from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ceiling speakers: a sweet orchestral cover version of the Beatles'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Norwegian Wood". The melody never failed to send a shudder&nbsp;</p>
<p>through me, but this time it hit me harder than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bent forward, my face in my hands to keep my skull from splitting&nbsp;</p>
<p>open. Before long one of the German stewardesses approached and&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked in English if I were sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No," I said, "just dizzy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm sure. Thanks."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She smiled and left, and the music changed to a Billy Joel tune. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>straightened up and looked out of the window at the dark clouds&nbsp;</p>
<p>hanging over the North Sea, thinking of all I had lost in the course of&nbsp;</p>
<p>my life: times gone for ever, friends who had died or disappeared,&nbsp;</p>
<p>feelings I would never know again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plane reached the gate. People began unfastening their seatbelts&nbsp;</p>
<p>and pulling luggage from the overhead lockers, and all the while I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the meadow. I could smell the grass, feel the wind on my face, hear&nbsp;</p>
<p>the cries of the birds. Autumn 1969, and soon I would be 20.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stewardess came to check on me again. This time she sat next to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me and asked if I was all right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm fine, thanks," I said with a smile. "Just feeling kind of blue."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know what you mean," she said. "It happens to me, too, every once&nbsp;</p>
<p>in a while."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She stood and gave me a lovely smile. "Well, then, have a nice trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auf Wiedersehen."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Auf Wiedersehen."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eighteen years have gone by, and still I can bring back every detail of&nbsp;</p>
<p>that day in the meadow. Washed clean of summer's dust by days of&nbsp;</p>
<p>gentle rain, the mountains wore a deep, brilliant green. The October&nbsp;</p>
<p>breeze set white fronds of head-high grasses swaying. One long streak&nbsp;</p>
<p>of cloud hung pasted across a dome of frozen blue. It almost hurt to&nbsp;</p>
<p>look at that far-off sky. A puff of wind swept across the meadow and&nbsp;</p>
<p>through her hair before it slipped into the woods to rustle branches and&nbsp;</p>
<p>send back snatches of distant barking - a hazy sound that seemed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>reach us from the doorway to another world. We heard no other&nbsp;</p>
<p>sounds. We met no other people. We saw only two bright red birds&nbsp;</p>
<p>leap startled from the center of the meadow and dart into the woods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we ambled along, Naoko spoke to me of wells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene I hardly paid it any&nbsp;</p>
<p>attention. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make&nbsp;</p>
<p>a lasting impression, certainly never imagined that 18 years later I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would recall it in such detail. I didn't give a damn about the scenery&nbsp;</p>
<p>that day. I was thinking about myself. I was thinking about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful girl walking next to me. I was thinking about the two of us&nbsp;</p>
<p>together, and then about myself again. I was at that age, that time of&nbsp;</p>
<p>life when every sight, every feeling, every thought came back, like a&nbsp;</p>
<p>boomerang, to me. And worse, I was in love. Love with&nbsp;</p>
<p>complications. Scenery was the last thing on my mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, though, that meadow scene is the first thing that comes back to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. The smell of the grass, the faint chill of the wind, the line of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>hills, the barking of a dog: these are the first things, and they come&nbsp;</p>
<p>with absolute clarity. I feel as if I can reach out and trace them with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>fingertip. And yet, as clear as the scene may be, no one is in it. No&nbsp;</p>
<p>one. Naoko is not there, and neither am I. Where could we have&nbsp;</p>
<p>disappeared to? How could such a thing have happened? Everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>that seemed so important back then - Naoko, and the self I was then,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the world I had then: where could they have all gone? It's true, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can't even bring back her face - not straight away, at least. All I'm left&nbsp;</p>
<p>holding is a background, pure scenery, with no people at the front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>True, given time enough, I can remember her face. I start joining&nbsp;</p>
<p>images - her tiny, cold hand; her straight, black hair so smooth and&nbsp;</p>
<p>cool to the touch; a soft, rounded earlobe and the microscopic mole&nbsp;</p>
<p>just beneath it; the camel-hair coat she wore in the winter; her habit of&nbsp;</p>
<p>looking straight into my eyes when asking a question; the slight&nbsp;</p>
<p>trembling that would come to her voice now and then (as though she&nbsp;</p>
<p>were speaking on a windy hilltop) - and suddenly her face is there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>always in profile at first, because Naoko and I were always out&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking together, side by side. Then she turns to me and smiles, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>tilts her head just a little, and begins to speak, and she looks into my&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes as if trying to catch the image of a minnow that has darted across&nbsp;</p>
<p>the pool of a limpid spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes time, though, for Naoko's face to appear. And as the years&nbsp;</p>
<p>have passed, the time has grown longer. The sad truth is that what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could recall in 5 seconds all too soon needed 10, then 30, then a full&nbsp;</p>
<p>minute - like shadows lengthening at dusk. Someday, I suppose, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>shadows will be swallowed up in darkness. There is no way around it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>my memory is growing ever more distant from the spot where Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>used to stand - where my old self used to stand. And nothing but&nbsp;</p>
<p>scenery, that view of the meadow in October, returns again and again&nbsp;</p>
<p>to me like a symbolic scene in a film. Each time it appears, it delivers&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&nbsp;</p>
<p>a kick to some part of my mind. Wake up, it says. I'm still here. Wake&nbsp;</p>
<p>up and think about it. Think about why I'm still here. The kicking&nbsp;</p>
<p>never hurts me. There's no pain at all. Just a hollow sound that echoes&nbsp;</p>
<p>with each kick. And even that is bound to fade one day. At Hamburg&nbsp;</p>
<p>airport, though, the kicks were longer and harder than usual. Which is&nbsp;</p>
<p>why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be the way I'm made. I have to write things down to feel I fully&nbsp;</p>
<p>comprehend them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's see, now, what was Naoko talking about that day?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course: the "field well". I have no idea whether there was such a&nbsp;</p>
<p>well. It might have been an image or a sign that existed only inside&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko, like all the other things she used to spin into existence inside&nbsp;</p>
<p>her mind in those dark days. Once she had described it to me, though,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was never able to think of that meadow scene without the well. From&nbsp;</p>
<p>that day forward, the image of a thing I had never laid eyes on became&nbsp;</p>
<p>inseparably fused to the actual scene of the field that lay before me. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can describe the well in minute detail. It lay precisely on the border&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the meadow ended and the woods began - a dark opening in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>earth a yard across, hidden by grass. Nothing marked its perimeter -&nbsp;</p>
<p>no fence, no stone curb (at least not one that rose above ground level).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was nothing but a hole, a wide-open mouth. The stones of its collar&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been weathered and turned a strange muddy-white. They were&nbsp;</p>
<p>cracked and chunks were missing, and a little green lizard slithered&nbsp;</p>
<p>into an open seam. You could lean over the edge and peer down to see&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing. All I knew about the well was its frightening depth. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>deep beyond measuring, and crammed full of darkness, as if all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>world's darknesses had been boiled down to their ultimate density.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's really, really deep," said Naoko, choosing her words with care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She would speak that way sometimes, slowing down to find the exact&nbsp;</p>
<p>word she was looking for. "But no one knows where it is," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>continued. "The one thing I know for sure is that it's around here&nbsp;</p>
<p>8&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhere."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hands thrust into the pockets of her tweed jacket, she smiled at me as&nbsp;</p>
<p>if to say "It's true!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then it must be incredibly dangerous," I said. "A deep well, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>nobody knows where it is. You could fall in and that'd be the end of&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The end. Aaaaaaaah! Splat! Finished."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Things like that must happen."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They do, every once in a while. Maybe once in two or three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somebody disappears all of a sudden, and they just can't find him. So&nbsp;</p>
<p>then the people around here say, "Oh, he fell in the field well'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not a nice way to die," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, it's a terrible way to die," said Naoko, brushing a cluster of grass&nbsp;</p>
<p>seed from her jacket. "The best thing would be to break your neck, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>you'd probably just break your leg and then you couldn't do a thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'd yell at the top of your lungs, but nobody would hear you, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>you couldn't expect anyone to find you, and you'd have centipedes and&nbsp;</p>
<p>spiders crawling all over you, and the bones of the ones who died&nbsp;</p>
<p>before are scattered all around you, and it's dark and soggy, and high&nbsp;</p>
<p>overhead there's this tiny, tiny circle of light like a winter moon. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>die there in this place, little by little, all by yourself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yuck, just thinking about it makes my flesh creep," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Somebody should find the thing and build a wall around it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But nobody can find it. So make sure you don't go off the path."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I won't."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko took her left hand from her pocket and squeezed my hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't you worry," she said. "You'll be OK. You could go running all&nbsp;</p>
<p>around here in the middle of the night and you'd never fall into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>well. And as long as I stick with you, I won't fall in, either."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How can you be so sure?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>9&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I just know," she said, increasing her grip on my hand and walking&nbsp;</p>
<p>along in silence. "I know these things. I'm always right. It's got&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I'm really&nbsp;</p>
<p>close to you like this, I'm not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or evil&nbsp;</p>
<p>could ever tempt me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, that's the answer," I said. "All you have to do is stay with me&nbsp;</p>
<p>like this all the time."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you mean that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko stopped short. So did I. She put her hands on my shoulders and&nbsp;</p>
<p>peered into my eyes. Deep within her own pattern. Those beautiful&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes of hers were looking inside me for a long, long time. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>stretched to her full height and touched her cheek to mine. It was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>marvelous, warm gesture that stopped my heart for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thank you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My pleasure," I answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm so happy you said that. Really happy," she said with a sad smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But it's impossible."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Impossible? Why?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It would be wrong. It would be terrible. It - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko clamped her mouth shut and started walking again. I could tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>that all kinds of thoughts were whirling around in her head, so rather&nbsp;</p>
<p>than intrude on them I kept silent and walked by her side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It would be wrong - wrong for you, wrong for me," she said after a&nbsp;</p>
<p>long pause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wrong how?" I murmured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't you see? It's just not possible for one person to watch over&nbsp;</p>
<p>another person forever and ever. I mean, suppose we got married.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'd have to work during the day. Who's going to watch over me&nbsp;</p>
<p>while you're away? Or if you go on a business trip, who's going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>watch over me then? Can I be glued to you every minute of our lives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of equality would there be in that? What kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>10&nbsp;</p>
<p>relationship would that be? Sooner or later you'd get sick of me. You'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonder what you were doing with your life, why you were spending&nbsp;</p>
<p>all your time babysitting this woman. I couldn't stand that. It wouldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>solve any of my problems."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But your problems are not going to continue for the rest of your life,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, touching her back. "They'll end eventually. And when they do,&nbsp;</p>
<p>we'll stop and think about how to go on from there. Maybe you will&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to help me. We're not running our lives according to some&nbsp;</p>
<p>account book. If you need me, use me. Don't you see? Why do you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to be so rigid? Relax, let down your guard. You're all tensed up&nbsp;</p>
<p>so you always expect the worst. Relax your body, and the rest of you&nbsp;</p>
<p>will lighten up."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How can you say that?" she asked in a voice drained of feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko's voice alerted me to the possibility that I had said something I&nbsp;</p>
<p>shouldn't have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me how you could say such a thing," she said, staring at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ground beneath her feet. "You're not telling me anything I don't know&nbsp;</p>
<p>already. "Relax your body, and the rest of you will lighten up.' What's&nbsp;</p>
<p>the point of saying that to me? If I relaxed my body now, I'd fall apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've always lived like this, and it's the only way I know how to go on&nbsp;</p>
<p>living. If I relaxed for a second, I'd never find my way back. I'd go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>pieces, and the pieces would be blown away. Why can't you see that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you talk about watching over me if you can't see that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm confused. Really confused. And it's a lot deeper than you think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deeper ... darker ... colder. But tell me something. How could you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have slept with me that time? How could you have done such a thing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why didn't you just leave me alone?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we were walking through the frightful silence of a pine forest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The desiccated corpses of cicadas that had died at the end of summer&nbsp;</p>
<p>littered the surface of the path, crunching beneath our shoes. As if&nbsp;</p>
<p>searching for something we'd lost, Naoko and I continued slowly&nbsp;</p>
<p>11&nbsp;</p>
<p>along the path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said, taking my arm and shaking her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to hurt you. Try not to let what I said bother you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really, I'm sorry. I was just angry at myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose I don't really understand you yet," I said. "I'm not all that&nbsp;</p>
<p>smart. It takes me a while to understand things. But if I do have the&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, I will come to understand you - better than anyone else in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>world."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We came to a stop and stood in the silent forest, listening. I tumbled&nbsp;</p>
<p>pinecones and cicada shells with my toecap, then looked up at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>patches of sky showing through the pine branches. Hands in pockets,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko stood there thinking, her eyes focused on nothing in particular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me something, Toru," she said. "Do you love me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know I do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Will you do me two favors?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can have up to three wishes, Madame."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko smiled and shook her head. "No, two will do. One is for you to&nbsp;</p>
<p>realize how grateful I am that you came to see me here. I hope you'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>understand how happy you've made me. I know it's going to save me&nbsp;</p>
<p>if anything will. I may not show it, but it's true."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll come to see you again," I said. "And what is the other wish?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I want you always to remember me. Will you remember that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>existed, and that I stood next to you here like this?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Always," I said. "I'll always remember."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She walked on without speaking. The autumn light filtering through&nbsp;</p>
<p>the branches danced over the shoulders of her jacket. A dog barked&nbsp;</p>
<p>again, closer than before. Naoko climbed a small mound, walked out&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the forest and hurried down a gentle slope. I followed two or three&nbsp;</p>
<p>steps behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come over here," I called towards her back. "The well might be&nbsp;</p>
<p>around here somewhere." Naoko stopped and smiled and took my&nbsp;</p>
<p>arm. We walked the rest of the way side by side. "Do you really&nbsp;</p>
<p>12&nbsp;</p>
<p>promise never to forget me?" she asked in a near whisper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll never forget you," I said. "I could never forget you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even so, my memory has grown increasingly dim, and I have already&nbsp;</p>
<p>forgotten any number of things. Writing from memory like this, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>often feel a pang of dread. What if I've forgotten the most important&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing? What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all&nbsp;</p>
<p>the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it's all I have to work with. Clutching these faded,&nbsp;</p>
<p>fading, imperfect memories to my breast, I go on writing this book&nbsp;</p>
<p>with all the desperate intensity of a starving man sucking on bones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the only way I know to keep my promise to Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once, long ago, when I was still young, when the memories were far&nbsp;</p>
<p>more vivid than they are now, I often tried to write about her. But I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't produce a line. I knew that if that first line would come, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>rest would pour itself onto the page, but I could never make it happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was too sharp and clear, so that I could never tell where to&nbsp;</p>
<p>start - the way a map that shows too much can sometimes be useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, though, I realize that all I can place in the imperfect vessel of&nbsp;</p>
<p>writing are imperfect memories and imperfect thoughts. The more the&nbsp;</p>
<p>memories of Naoko inside me fade, the more deeply I am able to&nbsp;</p>
<p>understand her. I know, too, why she asked me not to forget her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko herself knew, of course. She knew that my memories of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>would fade. Which is precisely why she begged me never to forget&nbsp;</p>
<p>her, to remember that she had existed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thought fills me with an almost unbearable sorrow. Because&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko never loved me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, many years ago - just 20 years ago, in fact - I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>living in a dormitory. I was 18 and a first-year student. I was new to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo and new to living alone, and so my anxious parents found a&nbsp;</p>
<p>private dorm for me to live in rather than the kind of single room that&nbsp;</p>
<p>most students took. The dormitory provided meals and other facilities&nbsp;</p>
<p>and would probably help their unworldly 18-year-old survive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expenses were also a consideration. A dorm cost far less than a&nbsp;</p>
<p>private room. As long as I had bedding and a lamp, there was no need&nbsp;</p>
<p>to buy a lot of furnishings. For my part, I would have preferred to rent&nbsp;</p>
<p>a flat and live in comfortable solitude, but knowing what my parents&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to spend on enrolment fees and tuition at the private university I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was attending, I was in no position to insist. And besides, I really&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't care where I lived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located on a hill in the middle of the city with open views, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dormitory compound sat on a large quadrangle surrounded by a&nbsp;</p>
<p>concrete wall. A huge, towering zelkova tree stood just inside the&nbsp;</p>
<p>front gate. People said it was at least 150 years old. Standing at its&nbsp;</p>
<p>base, you could look up and see nothing of the sky through its dense&nbsp;</p>
<p>cover of green leaves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paved path leading from the gate circumvented the tree and&nbsp;</p>
<p>continued on long and straight across a broad quadrangle, two three</p>
<p>story concrete dorm buildings facing each other on either side of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>path. They were large with lots of windows and gave the impression&nbsp;</p>
<p>of being either flats that had been converted into jails or jails that had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been converted into flats. However there was nothing dirty about&nbsp;</p>
<p>them, nor did they feel dark. You could hear radios playing through&nbsp;</p>
<p>open windows, all of which had the same cream-coloured curtains that&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sun could not fade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the two dormitories, the path led up to the entrance&nbsp;</p>
<p>of a two-story common building, the first floor of which contained a&nbsp;</p>
<p>dining hall and bathrooms, the second consisting of an auditorium,&nbsp;</p>
<p>meeting rooms, and even guest rooms, whose use I could never&nbsp;</p>
<p>14&nbsp;</p>
<p>fathom. Next to the common building stood a third dormitory, also&nbsp;</p>
<p>three storeys high. Broad green lawns filled the quadrangle, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>circulating sprinklers caught the sunlight as they turned. Behind the&nbsp;</p>
<p>common building there was a field used for baseball and football, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>six tennis courts. The complex had everything you could want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was just one problem with the place: its political smell. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>run by some kind of fishy foundation that centered on this extreme&nbsp;</p>
<p>right-wing guy, and there was something strangely twisted - as far as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was concerned - about the way they ran the place. You could see it in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the pamphlet they gave to new students and in the dorm rules. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>proclaimed "founding spirit" of the dormitory was "to strive to nurture&nbsp;</p>
<p>human resources of service to the nation through the ultimate in&nbsp;</p>
<p>educational fundamentals", and many financial leaders who endorsed&nbsp;</p>
<p>this "spirit" had contributed their private funds to the construction of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the place. This was the public face of the project, though what lay&nbsp;</p>
<p>behind it was extremely vague. Some said it was a tax dodge, others&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw it as a publicity stunt for the contributors, and still others claimed&nbsp;</p>
<p>that the construction of the dormitory was a cover for swindling the&nbsp;</p>
<p>public out of a&nbsp; prime piece of real estate. One thing was certain,&nbsp;</p>
<p>though: in the dorm complex there existed a privileged club composed&nbsp;</p>
<p>of elite students from various universities. They formed "study&nbsp;</p>
<p>groups" that met several times a month and included some of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>founders. Any member of the club could be assured of a good job after&nbsp;</p>
<p>graduation. I had no idea which - if any - of these theories was correct,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but they all shared the assumption that there was "something fishy"&nbsp;</p>
<p>about the place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, I spent two years - from the spring of 1968 to the spring&nbsp;</p>
<p>of 1970 - living in this "fishy" dormitory. Why I put up with it so long,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't really say. In terms of everyday life, it made no practical&nbsp;</p>
<p>difference to me whether the place was right wing or left wing or&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each day began with the solemn raising of the flag. They played the&nbsp;</p>
<p>15&nbsp;</p>
<p>national anthem, too, of course. You can't have one without the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flagpole stood in the very center of the compound, where it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>visible from every window of all three dormitories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Head of the east dormitory (my building) was in charge of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>flag. He was a tall, eagle-eyed man in his late fifties or early sixties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His bristly hair was flecked with grey, and his sunburned neck bore a&nbsp;</p>
<p>long scar. People whispered that he was a graduate of the wartime&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nakano spy school, but no one knew for sure. Next to him stood a&nbsp;</p>
<p>student who acted as his assistant. No one really knew this guy, either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had the world's shortest crewcut and always wore a navy-blue&nbsp;</p>
<p>student uniform. I didn't know his name or which room he lived in,&nbsp;</p>
<p>never saw him in the dining hall or the bath. I'm not even sure he was&nbsp;</p>
<p>a student, though you would think he must have been, given the&nbsp;</p>
<p>uniform - which quickly became his nickname. In contrast to Sir&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nakano, "Uniform" was short, pudgy and pasty-faced. This creepy&nbsp;</p>
<p>couple would raise the banner of the Rising Sun every morning at six.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first entered the dormitory, the sheer novelty of the event&nbsp;</p>
<p>would often prompt me to get up early to observe this patriotic ritual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two would appear in the quadrangle at almost the exact moment&nbsp;</p>
<p>the radio beeped the six o'clock signal. Uniform was wearing his&nbsp;</p>
<p>uniform, of course, with black leather shoes, and Nakano wore a short&nbsp;</p>
<p>jacket and white trainers. Uniform held a ceremonial box of untreated&nbsp;</p>
<p>paulownia wood, while Nakano carried a Sony tape recorder at his&nbsp;</p>
<p>side. He placed this at the base of the flagpole, while Uniform opened&nbsp;</p>
<p>the box to reveal a neatly folded banner. This he reverentially&nbsp;</p>
<p>proffered to Nakano, who would clip it to the rope on the flagpole,&nbsp;</p>
<p>revealing the bright red circle of the Rising Sun on a field of pure&nbsp;</p>
<p>white. Then Uniform pressed the switch for the playing of the anthem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"May Our Lord's Reign..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And up the flag would climb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Until pebbles turn to boulders ..." It would reach halfway up the pole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And be covered with moss."&nbsp;</p>
<p>16&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it was at the top. The two stood to attention, rigid, looking up at&nbsp;</p>
<p>the flag, which was quite a sight on clear days when the wind was&nbsp;</p>
<p>blowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lowering of the flag at dusk was carried out with the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>ceremonial reverence, but in reverse. Down the banner would come&nbsp;</p>
<p>and find its place in the box. The national flag did not fly at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know why the flag had to be taken down at night. The nation&nbsp;</p>
<p>continued to exist while it was dark, and plenty of people worked all&nbsp;</p>
<p>night - railway construction crews and taxi drivers and bar hostesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>and firemen and night watchmen: it seemed unfair to me that such&nbsp;</p>
<p>people were denied the protection of the flag. Or maybe it didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>matter all that much and nobody really cared - aside from me. Not that&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really cared, either. It was just something that happened to cross my&nbsp;</p>
<p>mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules for room assignments put first- and second-year students in&nbsp;</p>
<p>doubles while third- and final-year students had single rooms. Double&nbsp;</p>
<p>rooms were a little longer and narrower than nine-by-twelve, with an&nbsp;</p>
<p>aluminium-framed window in the wall opposite the door and two&nbsp;</p>
<p>desks by the window arranged so the inhabitants of the room could&nbsp;</p>
<p>study back-to-back. To the left of the door stood a steel bunk bed. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>furniture supplied was sturdy and simple and included a pair of&nbsp;</p>
<p>lockers, a small coffee table, and some built-in shelves. Even the most&nbsp;</p>
<p>well-disposed observer would have had trouble calling this setting&nbsp;</p>
<p>poetic. The shelves of most rooms carried such items as transistor&nbsp;</p>
<p>radios, hairdryers, electric carafes and cookers, instant coffee, tea&nbsp;</p>
<p>bags, sugar cubes, and simple pots and bowls for preparing instant&nbsp;</p>
<p>ramen. The walls bore pin-ups from girlie magazines or stolen porno&nbsp;</p>
<p>movie posters. One guy had a photo of pigs mating, but this was a far</p>
<p>out exception to the usual naked women, girl pop singers or actresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bookshelves on the desks held textbooks, dictionaries and novels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filth of these all-male rooms was horrifying. Mouldy mandarin&nbsp;</p>
<p>skins clung to the bottoms of waste-paper baskets. Empty cans used&nbsp;</p>
<p>17&nbsp;</p>
<p>for ashtrays held mounds of cigarette butts, and when these started to&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoulder they'd be doused with coffee or beer and left to give off a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sour stink. Blackish&nbsp;</p>
<p>grime and bits of indefinable matter clung to all the bowls and dishes&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the shelves, and the floors were littered with instant ramen&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrappers and empty beer cans and discarded lids from one thing or&nbsp;</p>
<p>another. It never occurred to anyone to sweep up and throw these&nbsp;</p>
<p>things in the bin. Any wind that blew through would raise clouds of&nbsp;</p>
<p>dust. Each room had its own horrendous smell, but the components of&nbsp;</p>
<p>that smell were always the same: sweat, body odour and rubbish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dirty clothes would pile up under the beds, and without anyone&nbsp;</p>
<p>bothering to air the mattresses on a regular basis, these sweat</p>
<p>impregnated pads would give off odours beyond redemption. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>retrospect, it seems amazing that these shitpiles gave rise to no killer&nbsp;</p>
<p>epidemics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My room, on the other hand, was as sanitary as a morgue. The floor&nbsp;</p>
<p>and window were spotless, the mattresses were aired each week, all&nbsp;</p>
<p>pencils stood in the pencil holders, and even the curtains were washed&nbsp;</p>
<p>once a month. My room-mate was a cleanliness freak. None of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>others in the dorm believed me when I told them about the curtains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They didn't know that curtains could be washed. They believed,&nbsp;</p>
<p>rather, that curtains were semi-permanent parts of the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's something wrong with that guy," they'd say, labelling him a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nazi or a storm trooper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We didn't even have pin-ups. No, we had a photo of a canal in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amsterdam. I had put up a nude shot, but my room-mate had pulled it&nbsp;</p>
<p>down. "Hey, Watanabe," he said, "I-I'm not too crazy about this kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of thing," and up went the canal photo instead. I wasn't especially&nbsp;</p>
<p>attached to the nude, so I didn't protest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What the hell's that?" was the universal reaction to the Amsterdam&nbsp;</p>
<p>photo whenever any of the other guys came to my room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, Storm Trooper likes to wank looking at this," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>18&nbsp;</p>
<p>I meant it as a joke, but they all took me seriously - so seriously that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>began to believe it myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody sympathized with me for having Storm Trooper as a room</p>
<p>mate, but I really wasn't that upset about it. He left me alone as long as&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kept my area clean, and in fact having him as my room-mate made&nbsp;</p>
<p>things easier for me in many ways. He did all the cleaning, he took&nbsp;</p>
<p>care of sunning the mattresses, he threw out the rubbish. He'd give a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sniff and suggest a bath for me if I'd been too busy to wash for a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>days. He'd even point out when it was time for me to go to the barber's&nbsp;</p>
<p>or trim my nasal hair. The one thing that bothered me was the way he&nbsp;</p>
<p>would spray clouds of insecticide if he noticed a single fly in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>room, because then I had to take refuge in a neighbouring shitpile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storm Trooper was studying geography at a national university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he told me the first time we met, "I'm studying m-m-maps."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You like maps?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yup. When I graduate, I'm going to work for the Geographical&nbsp;</p>
<p>Survey Institute and make m-m-maps."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was impressed by the variety of dreams and goals that life could&nbsp;</p>
<p>offer. This was one of the very first new impressions I received when I&nbsp;</p>
<p>came to Tokyo for the first time. The thought struck me that society&nbsp;</p>
<p>needed a few people - just a few - who were interested in and even&nbsp;</p>
<p>passionate about mapmaking. Odd, though, that someone who wanted&nbsp;</p>
<p>to work for the government's Geographical Survey Institute should&nbsp;</p>
<p>stutter every time he said the word "map". Storm Trooper often didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>stutter at all, except when he pronounced the word "map", for which it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a 100 per cent certainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"W what are you studying?" he asked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Drama," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Gonna put on plays?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, just read scripts and do research. Racine, lonesco, Shakespeare,&nbsp;</p>
<p>stuff like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he had heard of Shakespeare but not the others. I hardly knew&nbsp;</p>
<p>19&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything about the others myself, I'd just seen their names in lecture&nbsp;</p>
<p>handouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You like plays?" he asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not especially."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This confused him, and when he was confused, his stuttering got&nbsp;</p>
<p>worse. I felt sorry I had done that to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I could have picked anything," I said. "Ethnology, Asian history. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>just happened to pick drama, that's all," which was not the most&nbsp;</p>
<p>convincing explanation I could have come up with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't get it," he said, looking as if he really didn't get it. "I like m</p>
<p>m-maps, so I decided to come to Tokyo and get my parents to s-send&nbsp;</p>
<p>me money so I could study m-m-maps. But not you, huh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>His approach made more sense than mine. I gave up trying to explain&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself. Then we drew lots (matchsticks) to choose bunks. He got the&nbsp;</p>
<p>upper bunk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tall, with a crewcut and high cheekbones, he always wore the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>outfit: white shirt, black trousers, black shoes, navy-blue jumper. To&nbsp;</p>
<p>these he would add a uniform jacket and black briefcase when he went&nbsp;</p>
<p>to his university: a typical right-wing student. Which is why&nbsp;</p>
<p>everybody called him Storm Trooper. But in fact he was totally&nbsp;</p>
<p>indifferent to politics. He wore a uniform because he didn't want to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>bothered choosing clothes. What interested him were things like&nbsp;</p>
<p>changes in the coastline or the completion of a new railway tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing else. He'd go on for hours once he got started on a subject&nbsp;</p>
<p>like that, until you either ran away or fell asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was up at six each morning with the strains of "May Our Lord's&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reign". Which is to say that that ostentatious flag-raising ritual was&nbsp;</p>
<p>not entirely useless. He'd get dressed, go to the bathroom and wash his&nbsp;</p>
<p>face - for ever. I sometimes got the feeling he must be taking out each&nbsp;</p>
<p>tooth and washing it, one at a time. Back in the room, he would snap&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wrinkles out of his towel and lay it on the radiator to dry, then&nbsp;</p>
<p>return his toothbrush and soap to the shelf. Finally he'd do radio&nbsp;</p>
<p>20&nbsp;</p>
<p>callisthenics with the rest of the nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was used to reading late at night and sleeping until eight o'clock, so&nbsp;</p>
<p>even when he started shuffling around the room and exercising, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>remained unconscious - until the part where he started jumping. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>took his jumping seriously and made the bed bounce every time he hit&nbsp;</p>
<p>the floor. I stood it for three days because they had told us that&nbsp;</p>
<p>communal life called for a certain degree of resignation, but by the&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning of the fourth day, I couldn't take it any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, can you do that on the roof or somewhere?" I said. "I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But it's already 6.30!" he said, open-mouthed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know it's 6.30. I'm still supposed to be asleep. I don't know&nbsp;</p>
<p>how to explain it exactly, but that's how it works for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, I can't do it on the roof. Somebody on the third floor would&nbsp;</p>
<p>complain. Here, we're over a storeroom."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So go out on the quad. On the lawn."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's no good, either. I don't have a transistor radio. I need to plug it&nbsp;</p>
<p>in. And you can't do radio callisthenics without music."&nbsp;</p>
<p>True, his radio was an old piece of junk without batteries. Mine was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>transistor portable, but it was strictly FM, for music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, let's compromise," I said. "Do your exercises but cut out the&nbsp;</p>
<p>jumping part. It's so damned noisy. What do you say?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"J-jumping? What's that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Jumping is jumping. Bouncing up and down." "But there isn't any&nbsp;</p>
<p>jumping."&nbsp;</p>
<p>My head was starting to hurt. I was ready to give up, but I wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>make my point. I got out of bed and started bouncing up and down&nbsp;</p>
<p>and singing the opening melody of NHK's radio callisthenics. "I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>talking about this," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, that. I guess you're right. I never noticed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"See what I mean?" I said, sitting on the edge of the bed. "Just cut out&nbsp;</p>
<p>that part. I can put up with the rest. Stop jumping and let me sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p>21&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But that's impossible," he said matter-of-factly. "I can't leave&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything out. I've been doing the same thing every day for ten years,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and once I start I do the whole routine unconsciously. If I left&nbsp;</p>
<p>something out, I wouldn't be able to do any of it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was nothing more for me to say. What could I have said? The&nbsp;</p>
<p>quickest way to put a stop to this was to wait for him to leave the&nbsp;</p>
<p>room and throw his goddamn radio out the goddamn window, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew if I did that all hell would break loose. Storm Trooper treasured&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything he owned. He smiled when he saw me sitting on the bed at&nbsp;</p>
<p>a loss for words, and tried to comfort me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, why don't you just get up and exercise with me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he went off to breakfast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko chuckled when I told her the story of Storm Trooper and his&nbsp;</p>
<p>radio callisthenics. I hadn't been trying to amuse her, but I ended up&nbsp;</p>
<p>laughing myself. Though her smile vanished in an instant, I enjoyed&nbsp;</p>
<p>seeing it for the first time in a long while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had left the train at Yotsuya and were walking along the&nbsp;</p>
<p>embankment by the station. It was a Sunday afternoon in the middle&nbsp;</p>
<p>of May. The brief on-and-off showers of the morning had cleared up&nbsp;</p>
<p>before noon, and a south wind had swept away the low-hanging&nbsp;</p>
<p>clouds. The brilliant green leaves of the cherry trees stirred in the air,&nbsp;</p>
<p>splashing sunlight in all directions. This was an early summer day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people we passed carried their jumpers or jackets over their&nbsp;</p>
<p>shoulders or in their arms. Everyone looked happy in the warm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon sun. The young men playing tennis in the courts&nbsp;</p>
<p>beyond the embankment had stripped down to their shorts. Only&nbsp;</p>
<p>where two nuns in winter habits sat talking on a bench did the summer&nbsp;</p>
<p>light seem not to reach, though both wore looks of satisfaction as they&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed chatting in the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes of walking and I was sweaty enough to take off my&nbsp;</p>
<p>thick cotton shirt and go with a T-shirt. Naoko had rolled the sleeves&nbsp;</p>
<p>22&nbsp;</p>
<p>of her light grey sweatshirt up to her elbows. It was nicely faded,&nbsp;</p>
<p>obviously having been washed many times. I felt as if I had seen her&nbsp;</p>
<p>in that shirt long before. This was just a feeling I had, not a clear&nbsp;</p>
<p>memory. I didn't have that much to remember about Naoko at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How do you like communal living?" she asked. "Is it fun to live with&nbsp;</p>
<p>a lot of other people?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, I've only been doing it a month or so. It's not that bad, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can stand it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She stopped at a fountain and took a sip, wiping her mouth with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>white handkerchief she took from her trouser pocket. Then she bent&nbsp;</p>
<p>over and carefully retied her laces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you think I could do it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What? Living in a dorm?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose it's all a matter of attitude. You could let a lot of things&nbsp;</p>
<p>bother you if you wanted to - the rules, the idiots who think they're hot&nbsp;</p>
<p>shit, the room-mates doing radio callisthenics at 6.30 in the morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it's pretty much the same anywhere you go, you can manage."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess so," she said with a nod. She seemed to be turning something&nbsp;</p>
<p>over in her mind. Then she looked straight into my eyes as if peering&nbsp;</p>
<p>at some unusual object. Now I saw that her eyes were so deep and&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear they made my heart thump. I realized that I had never had&nbsp;</p>
<p>occasion to look into her eyes like this. It was the first time the two of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us had ever gone walking together or talked at such length.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you thinking about living in a dorm or something?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-uh," she said. "I was just wondering what communal life would&nbsp;</p>
<p>be like. And. .." She seemed to be trying - and failing - to find exactly&nbsp;</p>
<p>the right word or expression. Then she sighed and looked down. "Oh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know. Never mind."&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was the end of the conversation. She continued walking east, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed just behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>23&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost a year had gone by since I had last seen Naoko, and in that&nbsp;</p>
<p>time she had lost so much weight as to look like a different person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plump cheeks that had been a special feature of hers were all but&nbsp;</p>
<p>gone, and her neck had become delicate and slender. Not that she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>bony now or unhealthy looking: there was something natural and&nbsp;</p>
<p>serene about the way she had slimmed down, as if she had been hiding&nbsp;</p>
<p>in some long, narrow space until she herself had become long and&nbsp;</p>
<p>narrow. And a lot prettier than I remembered. I wanted to tell her that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but couldn't find a good way to put it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had not planned to meet but had run into each other on the Chuo&nbsp;</p>
<p>commuter line. She had decided to see a film by herself, and I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>headed for the bookshops in Kanda - nothing urgent in either case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had suggested that we leave the train, which we happened to do in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yotsuya, where the green embankment makes for a nice place to walk&nbsp;</p>
<p>by the old castle moat. Alone together, we had nothing in particular to&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk about, and I wasn't quite sure why Naoko had suggested we get&nbsp;</p>
<p>off the train. We had never really had much to say to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko started walking the minute we hit the street, and I hurried after&nbsp;</p>
<p>her, keeping a few paces behind. I could have closed the distance&nbsp;</p>
<p>between us, but something held me back. I walked with my eyes on&nbsp;</p>
<p>her shoulders and her straight black hair. She wore a big, brown&nbsp;</p>
<p>hairslide, and when she turned her head I caught a glimpse of a small,&nbsp;</p>
<p>white ear. Now and then she would look back and say something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it would be a remark I might have responded to, and some</p>
<p>times it would be something to which I had no idea how to reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other times, I simply couldn't hear what she was saying. She didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>seem to care one way or another. Once she had finished saying&nbsp;</p>
<p>whatever she wanted to say, she'd face front again and keep on&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking. Oh, well, I told myself, it was a nice day for a stroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was no mere stroll for Naoko, though, judging from that walk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She turned right at Lidabashi, came out at the moat, crossed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>intersection at Jinbocho, climbed the hill at Ochanomizu and came out&nbsp;</p>
<p>24&nbsp;</p>
<p>at Hongo. From there she followed the tram tracks to Komagome. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a challenging route. By the time we reached Komagome, the sun&nbsp;</p>
<p>was sinking and the day had become a soft spring evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where are we?" asked Naoko, as if noticing our surroundings for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Komagome," I said. "Didn't you know? We made this big arc."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why did we come here?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You brought us here. I was just following you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went to a shop by the station for a bowl of noodles. Thirsty, I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>a whole beer to myself. Neither of us said a word from the time we&nbsp;</p>
<p>gave our order to the time we finished eating. I was exhausted from all&nbsp;</p>
<p>that walking, and she just sat there with her hands on the table,&nbsp;</p>
<p>mulling something over again. All the leisure spots were crowded on&nbsp;</p>
<p>this warm Sunday, they were saying on the TV news. And we just&nbsp;</p>
<p>walked from Yotsuya to Komagome, I said to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, you're in good shape," I said when I had finished my noodles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Surprised?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was a long distance runner at school, I'll have you know. I used to&nbsp;</p>
<p>do the 10,000 metres. And my father took me mountain climbing on&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays ever since I can remember. You know our house - right there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>next to the mountain. I've always had strong legs."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It doesn't show," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know," she answered. "Everybody thinks I'm this delicate little girl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you can't judge a book by its cover." To which she added a&nbsp;</p>
<p>momentary smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And that goes for me, too," I said. "I'm worn out."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I've been dragging you around all day." "Still, I'm glad&nbsp;</p>
<p>we had a chance to talk. We've never done that before, just the two of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us," I said, trying without success to recall what we had talked about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was playing with the ashtray on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder. .." she began, ". . . if you wouldn't mind ... I mean, if it&nbsp;</p>
<p>25&nbsp;</p>
<p>really wouldn't be any bother to you ... Do you think we could see&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other again? I know I don't have any right to be asking you this."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Any right? What do you mean by that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>She blushed. My reaction to her request might have been a little too&nbsp;</p>
<p>strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know ... I can't really explain it," she said, tugging the sleeves&nbsp;</p>
<p>of her sweatshirt up over the elbows and down again. The soft hair on&nbsp;</p>
<p>her arms shone a lovely golden colour in the lights of the shop. "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't mean to say "right' exactly. I was looking for another way to put&nbsp;</p>
<p>it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elbows on the table, she stared at the calendar on the wall, almost as&nbsp;</p>
<p>though she were hoping to find the proper expression there. Failing,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she sighed and closed her eyes and played with her hairslide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never mind," I said. "I think I know what you're getting at. I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>sure how to put it, either."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can never say what I want to say," continued Naoko. "It's been like&nbsp;</p>
<p>this for a while now. I try to say something, but all I get are the wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p>words - the wrong words or the exact opposite words from what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>mean. I try to correct myself, and that only makes it worse. I lose track&nbsp;</p>
<p>of what I was trying to say to begin with. It's like I'm split in two and&nbsp;</p>
<p>playing tag with myself. One half is chasing the other half around this&nbsp;</p>
<p>big, fat post. The other me has the right words, but this me can't catch&nbsp;</p>
<p>her." She raised her face and looked into my eyes. "Does this make&nbsp;</p>
<p>any sense to you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Everybody feels like that to some extent," I said. "They're trying to&nbsp;</p>
<p>express themselves and it bothers t can't get it right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko looked disappointed with my answer. "No, that’s not it either,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said without further explanation&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, I'd be glad to see you again," I said. "I'm always free on&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays, and walking would be good for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We boarded the Yamanote Line, and Naoko transferred to the Chuo&nbsp;</p>
<p>Line at Shinjuku. She was living in a tiny flat way out in the western&nbsp;</p>
<p>26&nbsp;</p>
<p>suburb of Kokubunji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me," she said as we parted. "Has anything changed about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>way I talk?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think so," I said, "but I'm not sure what. Tell you the truth, I know I&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw you a lot back then, but I don't remember talking to you much."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's true," she said. "Anyway, can I call you on Saturday?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure. I'll be expecting to hear from you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first met Naoko when I was in the sixth-form at school. She was also&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the sixth-form at a posh girls' school run by one of the Christian&nbsp;</p>
<p>missions. The school was so refined you were considered unrefined if&nbsp;</p>
<p>you studied too much. Naoko was the girlfriend of my best (and only)&nbsp;</p>
<p>friend, Kizuki. The two of them had been close almost from birth,&nbsp;</p>
<p>their houses not 200 yards apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with most couples who have been together since childhood, there&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a casual openness about the relationship of Kizuki and Naoko and&nbsp;</p>
<p>little sense that they wanted to be alone together. They were always&nbsp;</p>
<p>visiting each other's homes and eating or playing mah-jong with each&nbsp;</p>
<p>other's families. I double-dated with them any number of times. Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>would bring a school friend for me and the four of us would go to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>zoo or the pool or the cinema. The girls she brought were always&nbsp;</p>
<p>pretty, but a little too refined for my taste. I got along better with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhat cruder girls from my own State school who were easier to&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk to. I could never tell what was going on inside the pretty heads of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the girls that Naoko brought along, and they probably couldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>understand me, either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a while, Kizuki gave up trying to arrange dates for me, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>instead the three of us would do things together. Kizuki and Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I: odd, but that was the most comfortable combination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introducing a fourth person into the mix would always make things a&nbsp;</p>
<p>little awkward. We were like a TV talk show, with me the guest,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki the talented host, and Naoko his assistant. He was good at&nbsp;</p>
<p>27&nbsp;</p>
<p>occupying that central position. True, he had a sarcastic side that often&nbsp;</p>
<p>struck people as arrogant, but in fact he was a considerate and fair</p>
<p>minded person. He would distribute his remarks and jokes fairly to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and to me, taking care to see that neither of us felt left out. If&nbsp;</p>
<p>one or the other stayed quiet too long, he would steer his conversation&nbsp;</p>
<p>in that direction and get the person to talk. It probably looked harder&nbsp;</p>
<p>than it was: he knew how to monitor and adjust the air around him on&nbsp;</p>
<p>a second-by-second basis. In addition, he had a rare talent for finding&nbsp;</p>
<p>the interesting parts of someone's generally uninteresting comments so&nbsp;</p>
<p>that, while speaking to him, you felt you were an exceptionally&nbsp;</p>
<p>interesting person with an exceptionally interesting life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet he was not the least bit sociable. I was his only real friend at&nbsp;</p>
<p>school. I could never understand why such a smart and capable talker&nbsp;</p>
<p>did not turn his talents to the broader world around him but remained&nbsp;</p>
<p>satisfied to concentrate on our little trio. Nor could I understand why&nbsp;</p>
<p>he picked me to be his friend. I was just an ordinary kid who liked to&nbsp;</p>
<p>read books and listen to music and didn't stand out in any way that&nbsp;</p>
<p>would prompt someone like Kizuki to pay attention to me. We hit it&nbsp;</p>
<p>off straight away, though. His father was a dentist, known for his&nbsp;</p>
<p>professional skill and his high fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Want to double-date Sunday?" he asked me just after we met. "My&nbsp;</p>
<p>girlfriend goes to a girls' school, and she'll bring along a cute one for&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure," I said, and that was how I met Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three of us spent a lot of time together, but whenever Kizuki left&nbsp;</p>
<p>the room, Naoko and I had trouble talking to each other. We never&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew what to talk about. And in fact there was no topic of&nbsp;</p>
<p>conversation that we had in common. Instead of talking, we'd drink&nbsp;</p>
<p>water or toy with something on the table and wait for Kizuki to come&nbsp;</p>
<p>back and start up the conversation again. Naoko was not particularly&nbsp;</p>
<p>talkative, and I was more of a listener than a talker, so I felt&nbsp;</p>
<p>28&nbsp;</p>
<p>uncomfortable when I was left alone with her. Not that we were&nbsp;</p>
<p>incompatible: we just had nothing to talk about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and I saw each other only once after Kizuki's funeral. Two&nbsp;</p>
<p>weeks after the event, we met at a café to take care of some minor&nbsp;</p>
<p>matter, and when that was finished we had nothing more to say. I tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>raising several different topics, but none of them led anywhere. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>when Naoko did talk, there was an edge to her voice. She seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>angry with me, but I had no idea why. We never saw each other again&nbsp;</p>
<p>until that day a year later we happened to meet on the Chuo Line in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko might have been angry with me because I, not she, had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>the last one to see Kizuki. That may not be the best way to put it, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>more or less understood how she felt. I would have swapped places&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her if I could have, but finally, what had happened had happened,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and there was nothing I could do about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been a nice afternoon in May. After lunch, Kizuki suggested we&nbsp;</p>
<p>skip classes and go play pool or something. I had no special interest in&nbsp;</p>
<p>my afternoon classes, so together we left school, ambled down the hill&nbsp;</p>
<p>to a pool hall on the harbour, and played four games. When I won the&nbsp;</p>
<p>first, easy-going game, he became serious and won the next three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant I paid, according to our custom. Kizuki didn't make a&nbsp;</p>
<p>single joke as we played, which was most unusual. We smoked&nbsp;</p>
<p>afterwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why so serious?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I didn't want to lose today," said Kizuki with a satisfied smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He died that night in his garage. He led a rubber hose from the exhaust&nbsp;</p>
<p>pipe of his N-360 to a window, taped over the gap in the window, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>revved the engine. I have no idea how long it took him to die. His&nbsp;</p>
<p>parents had been out visiting a sick relative, and when they opened the&nbsp;</p>
<p>garage to put their car away, he was already dead. His radio was&nbsp;</p>
<p>going, and a petrol station receipt was tucked under the windscreen&nbsp;</p>
<p>29&nbsp;</p>
<p>wiper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki had left no suicide note, and had no motive that anyone could&nbsp;</p>
<p>think of. Because I had been the last one to see him, I was called in for&nbsp;</p>
<p>questioning by the police. I told the investigating officer that Kizuki&nbsp;</p>
<p>had given no indication of what he was about to do, that he had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>exactly the same as always. The policeman had obviously formed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>poor impression of both Kizuki and me, as if it was perfectly natural&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the kind of person who would skip classes and play pool to&nbsp;</p>
<p>commit suicide. A small article in the paper brought the affair to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>close. Kizuki's parents got rid of his red N-360. For a time, a white&nbsp;</p>
<p>flower marked his school desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ten months between Kizuki's death and my exams, I was unable&nbsp;</p>
<p>to find a place for myself in the world around me. I started sleeping&nbsp;</p>
<p>with one of the girls at school, but that didn't last six months. Nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>about her really got to me. I applied to a private university in Tokyo,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the kind of place with an entrance exam for which I wouldn't have to&nbsp;</p>
<p>study much, and I passed without exhilaration. The girl asked me not&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go to Tokyo - "It's 500 miles from here!" she pleaded - but I had to&nbsp;</p>
<p>get away from Kobe at any cost. I wanted to begin a new life where I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't know a soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You don't give a damn about me any more, now that you've slept&nbsp;</p>
<p>with me," she said, crying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's not true," I insisted. "I just need to get away from this town."&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she was not prepared to understand me. And so we parted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking about all the things that made her so much nicer than the&nbsp;</p>
<p>other girls at home, I sat on the bullet train to Tokyo feeling terrible&nbsp;</p>
<p>about what I'd done, but there was no way to undo it. I would try to&nbsp;</p>
<p>forget her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was only one thing for me to do when I started my new life in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the dorm: stop taking everything so seriously; establish a proper&nbsp;</p>
<p>distance between myself and everything else. Forget about green baize&nbsp;</p>
<p>pool tables and red N-360s and white flowers on school desks; about&nbsp;</p>
<p>30&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoke rising from tall crematorium chimneys, and chunky&nbsp;</p>
<p>paperweights in police interrogation rooms. It seemed to work at first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried hard to forget, but there remained inside me a vague knot of air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as time went by, the knot began to take on a clear and simple&nbsp;</p>
<p>form, a form that I am able to put into words, like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a cliché translated into words, but at the time I felt it not as words&nbsp;</p>
<p>but as that knot of air inside me. Death exists - in a paperweight, in&nbsp;</p>
<p>four red and white balls on a pool table - and we go on living and&nbsp;</p>
<p>breathing it into our lungs like fine dust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until that time, I had understood death as something entirely separate&nbsp;</p>
<p>from and independent of life. The hand of death is bound to take us, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had felt, but until the day it reaches out for us, it leaves us alone. This&nbsp;</p>
<p>had seemed to me the simple, logical truth. Life is here, death is over&nbsp;</p>
<p>there. I am here, not over there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night Kizuki died, however, I lost the ability to see death (and&nbsp;</p>
<p>life) in such simple terms. Death was not the opposite of life. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>already here, within my being, it had&nbsp;</p>
<p>always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it took the 17-year-old Kizuki that night in May, death took me&nbsp;</p>
<p>as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lived through the following spring, at 18, with that knot of air in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>chest, but I struggled all the while against becoming serious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Becoming serious was not the same thing as approaching the truth, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>sensed, however vaguely. But death was a fact, a serious fact, no&nbsp;</p>
<p>matter how you looked at it. Stuck inside this suffocating&nbsp;</p>
<p>contradiction, I went on endlessly spinning in circles. Those were&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange days, now that I look back at them. In the midst of life,&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything revolved around death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>31&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko called me the following Saturday, and that Sunday we had a&nbsp;</p>
<p>date. I suppose I can call it a date. I can't think of a better word for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As before, we walked the streets. We stopped somewhere&nbsp;</p>
<p>for coffee, walked some more, had dinner in the evening, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>said goodbye. Again, she talked only in snatches, but this didn't seem&nbsp;</p>
<p>to bother her, and I made no special effort to keep the conversation&nbsp;</p>
<p>going. We talked about whatever came to mind - our daily routines,&nbsp;</p>
<p>our colleges; each a little fragment that led nowhere. We said nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>at all about the past. And mainly, we walked - and walked, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>walked. Fortunately, Tokyo is such a big city we could never have&nbsp;</p>
<p>covered it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kept on walking like this almost every weekend. She would lead,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I would follow close behind. Naoko had a variety of hairslides&nbsp;</p>
<p>and always wore them with her right ear exposed. I remember her&nbsp;</p>
<p>most clearly this way, from the back. She would toy with her hairslide&nbsp;</p>
<p>whenever she felt embarrassed by something. And she was always&nbsp;</p>
<p>dabbing at her mouth with a handkerchief. She did this whenever she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had something to say. The more I observed these habits of hers, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>more I came to like her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko went to a girls' college on the rural western edge of Tokyo, a&nbsp;</p>
<p>nice little place famous for its teaching of English.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearby was a narrow irrigation canal with clean, clear water, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and I would often walk along its banks. Sometimes she would&nbsp;</p>
<p>invite me up to her flat and cook for me. It never seemed to concern&nbsp;</p>
<p>her that the two of us were in such close quarters together. The room&nbsp;</p>
<p>was small and neat and so lacking in frills that only the stockings&nbsp;</p>
<p>drying in the corner by the window gave any hint that a girl lived&nbsp;</p>
<p>32&nbsp;</p>
<p>there. She led a spare, simple life with hardly any friends. No one who&nbsp;</p>
<p>had known her at school could have imagined her like this. Back then,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had dressed with real flair and surrounded herself with a million&nbsp;</p>
<p>friends. When I saw her room, I realized that, like me, she had wanted&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go away to college and begin a new life far from anyone she knew.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Know why I chose this place?" she said with a smile. "Because&nbsp;</p>
<p>nobody from home was coming here. We were all supposed to go&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhere more chic. You know what I mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>My relationship with Naoko was not without its progress, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little by little, she grew more accustomed to me, and I to her. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>the summer holidays ended and a new term started, Naoko began&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking next to me as if it were the most natural thing in the world to&nbsp;</p>
<p>do. She saw me as a friend now, I concluded, and walking side by side&nbsp;</p>
<p>with such a beautiful girl was by no means painful for me. We kept&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking all over Tokyo in the same meandering way, climbing hills,&nbsp;</p>
<p>crossing rivers and railway lines, just walking and walking with no&nbsp;</p>
<p>destination in mind. We forged straight ahead, as if our walking were&nbsp;</p>
<p>a religious ritual meant to heal our wounded spirits. If it rained, we&nbsp;</p>
<p>used umbrellas, but in any case we walked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then came autumn, and the dormitory grounds were buried in zelkova&nbsp;</p>
<p>leaves. The fragrance of a new season arrived when I put on my first&nbsp;</p>
<p>pullover. Having worn out one pair of shoes, I bought some new suede&nbsp;</p>
<p>ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't seem to recall what we talked about then. Nothing special, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>expect. We continued to avoid any mention of the past and rarely&nbsp;</p>
<p>spoke about Kizuki. We could face each other over coffee cups in&nbsp;</p>
<p>total silence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko liked to hear me tell stories about Storm Trooper. Once he had&nbsp;</p>
<p>a date with a fellow student (a girl in geography, of course) but came&nbsp;</p>
<p>back in the early evening looking glum. "Tell me, W W-Watanabe,&nbsp;</p>
<p>what do you talk about with g-g-girls?" I don't remember how I&nbsp;</p>
<p>answered him, but he had picked the wrong person to ask. In July,&nbsp;</p>
<p>33&nbsp;</p>
<p>somebody in the dorm had taken down Storm Trooper's Amsterdam&nbsp;</p>
<p>canal scene and put up a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge instead. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>told me he wanted to know if Storm Trooper could masturbate to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golden Gate Bridge. "He loved it," I reported later, which prompted&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone else to put up a picture of an iceberg. Each time the photo&nbsp;</p>
<p>changed in his absence, Storm Trooper became upset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Who-who-who the hell is doing this?" he asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder," I said. "But what's the difference? They're all nice&nbsp;</p>
<p>pictures. You should be grateful."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I s'pose so, but it's weird."&nbsp;</p>
<p>My stories of Storm Trooper always made Naoko laugh. Not many&nbsp;</p>
<p>things succeeded in doing that, so I talked about him often, though I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was not exactly proud of myself for using him this way. He just&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened to be the youngest son in a not-too-wealthy family who had&nbsp;</p>
<p>grown up a little too serious for his own good. Making maps was the&nbsp;</p>
<p>one small dream of his one small life. Who had the right to make fun&nbsp;</p>
<p>of him for that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>By then, however, Storm-Trooper jokes had become an indispensable&nbsp;</p>
<p>source of dormitory talk, and there was no way for me to undo what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had done. Besides, the sight of Naoko's smiling face had become my&nbsp;</p>
<p>own special source of pleasure. I went on supplying everyone with&nbsp;</p>
<p>new stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko asked me one time - just once - if I had a girl I liked. I told her&nbsp;</p>
<p>about the one I had left behind in Kobe. "She was nice," I said, "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed sleeping with her, and I miss her every now and then, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>finally, she didn't move me. I don't know, sometimes I think I've got&nbsp;</p>
<p>this hard kernel in my heart, and nothing much can get inside it. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>doubt if I can really love anybody."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Have you ever been in love?" Naoko asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She didn't ask me more than that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When autumn ended and cold winds began tearing through the city,&nbsp;</p>
<p>34&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko would often walk pressed against my arm. I could sense her&nbsp;</p>
<p>breathing through the thick cloth of her duffel coat. She would&nbsp;</p>
<p>entwine her arm with mine, or cram her hand in my pocket, or, when&nbsp;</p>
<p>it was really cold, cling tightly to my arm, shivering. None of this had&nbsp;</p>
<p>any special meaning. I just kept walking with my hands shoved in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>pockets. Our rubber-soled shoes made hardly any sound on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>pavement, except for the dry crackling when we trod on the broad,&nbsp;</p>
<p>withered sycamore leaves. I felt sorry for Naoko whenever I heard that&nbsp;</p>
<p>sound. My arm was not the one she needed, but the arm of someone&nbsp;</p>
<p>else. My warmth was not what she needed, but the warmth of&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone else. I felt almost guilty being me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the winter deepened, the transparent clarity of Naoko's eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to increase. It was a clarity that had nowhere to go. Sometimes&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko would lock her eyes on to mine for no apparent reason. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to be searching for something, and this would give me a&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange, lonely, helpless sort of feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wondered if she was trying to convey something to me, something&nbsp;</p>
<p>she could not put into words - something prior to words that she could&nbsp;</p>
<p>not grasp within herself and which therefore had no hope of ever&nbsp;</p>
<p>turning into words. Instead, she would fiddle with her hairslide, dab at&nbsp;</p>
<p>the corners of her mouth with a handkerchief, or look into my eyes in&nbsp;</p>
<p>that meaningless way. I wanted to hold her tight when she did these&nbsp;</p>
<p>things, but I would hesitate and hold back. I was afraid I might hurt&nbsp;</p>
<p>her. And so the two of us kept walking the streets of Tokyo, Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>searching for words in space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guys in the dorm would always tease me when I got a call from&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko or went out on a Sunday morning. They assumed, naturally&nbsp;</p>
<p>enough, that I had found a girlfriend. There was no way to explain the&nbsp;</p>
<p>truth to them, and no need to explain it, so I let them think what they&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to. I had to face a barrage of stupid questions in the evening -&nbsp;</p>
<p>what position had we used? What was she like down there? What&nbsp;</p>
<p>colour underwear had she been wearing that day? I gave them the&nbsp;</p>
<p>35&nbsp;</p>
<p>answers they wanted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so I went from 18 to 19. Each day the sun would rise and set, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>flag would be raised and lowered. Every Sunday I would have a date&nbsp;</p>
<p>with my dead friend's girl. I had no idea what I was doing or what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was going to do. For my courses I would read Claudel and Racine and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eisenstein, but they meant almost nothing to me. I made no friends at&nbsp;</p>
<p>the lectures, and hardly knew anyone in the dorm. The others in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm thought I wanted to be a writer because I was always alone with&nbsp;</p>
<p>a book, but I had no such ambition. There was nothing I wanted to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to talk about this feeling with Naoko. She, at least, would be&nbsp;</p>
<p>able to understand what I was feeling with some degree of precision, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought. But I could never find the words to express myself. Strange, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to have caught her word-searching sickness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday nights I would sit by the phone in the lobby, waiting for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko to call. Most of the others were out, so the lobby was usually&nbsp;</p>
<p>deserted. I would stare at the grains of light suspended in that silent&nbsp;</p>
<p>space, struggling to see into my own heart. What did I want? And&nbsp;</p>
<p>what did others want from me? But I could never find the answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I would reach out and try to grasp the grains of light, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>my fingers touched nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read a lot, but not a lot of different books: I like to read my&nbsp;</p>
<p>favourites again and again. Back then it was Truman Capote, John&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updike, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Chandler, but I didn't see&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyone else in my lectures or the dorm reading writers like that. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>liked Kazumi Takahashi, Kenzaburo Oe, Yukio Mishima, or&nbsp;</p>
<p>contemporary French novelists, which was another reason I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have much to say to anybody but kept to myself and my books. With&nbsp;</p>
<p>my eyes closed, I would touch a familiar book and draw its fragrance&nbsp;</p>
<p>deep inside me. This was enough to make me happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 18 my favourite book was John Updike's The Centaur, but after I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had read it a number of times, it began to lose some of its initial lustre&nbsp;</p>
<p>36&nbsp;</p>
<p>and yielded first place to The Great Gatsby. Gatsby stayed in first&nbsp;</p>
<p>place for a long time after that. I would pull it off the shelf when the&nbsp;</p>
<p>mood hit me and read a section at random. It never once disappointed&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. There wasn't a boring page in the whole book. I wanted to tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>people what a wonderful novel it was, but no one around me had read&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Great Gatsby or was likely to. Urging others to read F Scott&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fitzgerald, although not a reactionary act, was not something one&nbsp;</p>
<p>could do in 1968.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I did finally meet the one person in my world who had read&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gatsby, he and I became friends because of it. His name was&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa. He was two years older than me, and because he was doing&nbsp;</p>
<p>legal studies at the prestigious Tokyo University, he was on the fast&nbsp;</p>
<p>track to national leadership. We lived in the same dorm and knew&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other only by sight, until one day when I was reading Gatsby in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sunny spot in the dining hall. He sat down next to me and asked what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was reading. When I told him, he asked if I was enjoying it. "This is&nbsp;</p>
<p>my third time," I said, "and every time I find something new that I like&nbsp;</p>
<p>even more than the last."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This man says he has read The Great Gatsby three times," he said as&nbsp;</p>
<p>if to himself. "Well, any friend of Gatsby is a friend of mine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so we became friends. This happened in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The better I got to know Nagasawa, the stranger he seemed. I had met&nbsp;</p>
<p>a lot of weird people in my day, but none as strange as Nagasawa. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a far more voracious reader than me, but he made it a rule never&nbsp;</p>
<p>to touch a book by any author who had not been dead at least 30 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's the only kind of book I can trust," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's not that I don't believe in contemporary literature," he added, "but&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to waste valuable time reading any book that has not had&nbsp;</p>
<p>the baptism of time. Life is too short."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What kind of authors do you like?" I asked, speaking in respectful&nbsp;</p>
<p>tones to this man two years my senior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Balzac, Dante, Joseph Conrad, Dickens," he answered without&nbsp;</p>
<p>37&nbsp;</p>
<p>hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not exactly fashionable."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's why I read them. If you only read the books that everyone else&nbsp;</p>
<p>is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world of hicks and slobs. Real people would be ashamed of&nbsp;</p>
<p>themselves doing that. Haven't you noticed, Watanabe? You and I are&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only real ones in this dorm. The other guys are crap."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This took me off guard. "How can you say that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"'Cause it's true. I know. I can see it. It's like we have marks on our&nbsp;</p>
<p>foreheads. And besides, we've both read The Great Gatsby."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some quick calculating. "But Fitzgerald's only been dead 28&nbsp;</p>
<p>years," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what? Two years? Fitzgerald's advanced."&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one else in the dorm knew that Nagasawa was a secret reader of&nbsp;</p>
<p>classic novels, nor would it have mattered if they had. Nagasawa was&nbsp;</p>
<p>known for being smart. He breezed into Tokyo University, he got&nbsp;</p>
<p>good marks, he would take the Civil Service Exam, join the Foreign&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ministry, and become a diplomat. He came from a wealthy family. His&nbsp;</p>
<p>father owned a big hospital in Nagoya, and his brother had also&nbsp;</p>
<p>graduated from Tokyo, gone on to medical school, and would one day&nbsp;</p>
<p>inherit the hospital. Nagasawa always had plenty of money in his&nbsp;</p>
<p>pocket, and he carried himself with real dignity. People treated him&nbsp;</p>
<p>with respect, even the dorm Head. When he asked someone to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>something, the person would do it without protest. There was no&nbsp;</p>
<p>choice in the matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa had a certain inborn quality that drew people to him and&nbsp;</p>
<p>made them follow him. He knew how to stand at the head of the pack,&nbsp;</p>
<p>to assess the situation, to give precise and tactful instructions that&nbsp;</p>
<p>others would obey. Above his head hung an aura that revealed his&nbsp;</p>
<p>powers like an angel's halo, the mere sight of which would inspire awe&nbsp;</p>
<p>in people for this superior being. Which is why it shocked everyone&nbsp;</p>
<p>38&nbsp;</p>
<p>that Nagasawa chose me, a person with no distinctive qualities, to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>his special friend. People I hardly knew treated me with a certain&nbsp;</p>
<p>respect because of it, but what they did not seem to realize was that&nbsp;</p>
<p>the reason for my having been chosen was a simple one, namely that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>treated Nagasawa with none of the adulation he received from other&nbsp;</p>
<p>people. I had a definite interest in the strange, complex aspects of his&nbsp;</p>
<p>nature, but none of those other things - his good marks, his aura, his&nbsp;</p>
<p>looks - impressed me. This must have been something new for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were sides to Nagasawa's personality that conflicted in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>extreme. Even I would be moved by his kindness at times, but he&nbsp;</p>
<p>could just as well be malicious and cruel. He was both a spirit of&nbsp;</p>
<p>amazing loftiness and an irredeemable man of the gutter. He could&nbsp;</p>
<p>charge forward, the optimistic leader, even as his heart writhed in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>swamp of loneliness. I saw these paradoxical qualities of his from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>start, and I could never understand why they weren't just as obvious to&nbsp;</p>
<p>everyone else. He lived in his own special hell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, I think I always managed to view him in the most favourable&nbsp;</p>
<p>light. His greatest virtue was his honesty. Not only would he never lie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>he would always acknowledge his shortcomings. He never tried to&nbsp;</p>
<p>hide things that might embarrass him. And where I was concerned, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>was unfailingly kind and supportive. Had he not been, my life in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm would have been far more unpleasant than it was. Still, I never&nbsp;</p>
<p>once opened my heart to him, and in that sense my relationship with&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa stood in stark contrast to me and Kizuki. The first time I&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw Nagasawa drunk and tormenting a girl, I promised myself never,&nbsp;</p>
<p>under any circumstances, to open myself up to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were several "Nagasawa Legends" that circulated throughout&nbsp;</p>
<p>the dorm. According to one, he supposedly once ate three slugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another gave him a huge penis and had him sleeping with more than&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 girls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slug story was true. He told me so himself. "Three big mothers,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>39&nbsp;</p>
<p>he said. "Swallowed 'em whole."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What the hell for?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, it happened the first year I came to live here," he said. "There&nbsp;</p>
<p>was some shit between the first-years and the third-years. Started in&nbsp;</p>
<p>April and finally came to a head in September. As first-year&nbsp;</p>
<p>representative I went to work things out with the third-years. Real&nbsp;</p>
<p>right-wing arseholes. They had these wooden kendo swords, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>"working things out' was probably the last thing they wanted to do. So&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, 'All right, let's put an end to this. Do what you want to me, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>leave the other guys alone.' So they said, "OK, let's see you swallow a&nbsp;</p>
<p>couple of slugs.' "Fine,' I said, "Let's have 'em.' The bastards went out&nbsp;</p>
<p>and got three huge slugs. And I swallowed 'em."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What was it like?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What was it like?' You have to swallow one yourself. The way it&nbsp;</p>
<p>slides down your throat and into your stomach ... it's cold, and it&nbsp;</p>
<p>leaves this disgusting aftertaste ... yuck, I get chills just thinking about&nbsp;</p>
<p>it. I wanted to puke but I fought it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, if I had puked 'em up, I would have had to swallow&nbsp;</p>
<p>'em all over again. So I kept 'em down. All three of 'em."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then what happened?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I went back to my room and drank a bucket of salt water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What else could I do?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess so."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But after that, nobody could say a thing to me. Not even&nbsp;</p>
<p>the third-years. I'm the only guy in this place who can swallow three&nbsp;</p>
<p>slugs."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I bet you are."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finding out about his penis size was easy enough. I just went to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm's communal shower with him. He had a big one, all right. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 girls was probably an exaggeration. "Maybe 75," he said. "I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember them all, but I'm sure it's at least 70." When I told him I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>40&nbsp;</p>
<p>slept with only one, he said, "Oh, we can fix that, easy. Come with me&nbsp;</p>
<p>next time. I'll get you one easy as that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't believe him, but he turned out to be right. It was easy. Almost&nbsp;</p>
<p>too easy, with all the excitement of flat beer. We went to some kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>bar in Shibuya or Shinjuku (he had his favourites), found a pair of&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls (the world was full of pairs of girls), talked to them, drank, went&nbsp;</p>
<p>to a hotel, and had sex with them. He was a great talker. Not that he&nbsp;</p>
<p>had anything great to say, but girls would get carried away listening to&nbsp;</p>
<p>him, they'd drink too much and end up sleeping with him. I guess they&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed being with somebody so nice and handsome and clever. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>the most amazing thing was that, just because I was with him, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to become equally fascinating to them. Nagasawa would urge&nbsp;</p>
<p>me to talk, and girls would respond to me with the same smiles of&nbsp;</p>
<p>admiration they offered him. He worked his magic, a real talent he had&nbsp;</p>
<p>that impressed me every time. Compared with Nagasawa, Kizuki's&nbsp;</p>
<p>conversational gifts were child's play. This was a completely different&nbsp;</p>
<p>level of accomplishment. As much as I found myself caught up in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa's power, though, I still missed Kizuki. I felt a new&nbsp;</p>
<p>admiration for his sincerity. Whatever talents he had he would share&nbsp;</p>
<p>with Naoko and me alone, while Nagasawa was bent on disseminating&nbsp;</p>
<p>his considerable gifts to all around him. Not that he was dying to sleep&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the girls he found: it was just a game to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not too crazy about sleeping with girls I didn't know. It was an&nbsp;</p>
<p>easy way to take care of my sex drive of course, and I did enjoy all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>holding and touching, but I hated the morning after. I'd wake up and&nbsp;</p>
<p>find this strange girl sleeping next to me, and the room would reek of&nbsp;</p>
<p>alcohol, and the bed and the lighting and the curtains had that special&nbsp;</p>
<p>"love hotel" garishness, and my head would be in a hungover fog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the girl would wake up and start groping around for her knickers&nbsp;</p>
<p>41&nbsp;</p>
<p>and while she was putting on her stockings she'd say something like,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hope you used one last night. It's the worst day of the month for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me." Then she'd sit in front of a mirror and start grumbling about her&nbsp;</p>
<p>aching head or her uncooperative make-up while she redid her lipstick&nbsp;</p>
<p>or attached her false eyelashes. I would have preferred not to spend&nbsp;</p>
<p>the whole night with them, but you can't worry about a midnight&nbsp;</p>
<p>curfew while you're seducing women (which runs counter to the laws&nbsp;</p>
<p>of physics anyway), so I'd go out with an overnight pass. This meant I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to stay put until morning and go back to the dorm filled with self</p>
<p>loathing and disillusionment, sunlight stabbing my eyes, mouth coated&nbsp;</p>
<p>with sand, head belonging to someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I had slept with three or four girls this way, I asked Nagasawa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"After you've done this 70 times, doesn't it begin to seem kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>pointless?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That proves you're a decent human being," he said. "Congratulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing to be gained from sleeping with one&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange woman after another. It just tires you out and makes you&nbsp;</p>
<p>disgusted with yourself. It's the same for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So why the hell do you keep it up?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hard to say. Hey, you know that thing Dostoevsky wrote on&nbsp;</p>
<p>gambling? It's like that. When you're surrounded by endless&nbsp;</p>
<p>possibilities, one of the hardest things you can do is pass them up. See&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sort of."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look. The sun goes down. The girls come out and drink. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>wander around, looking for something. I can give them that&nbsp;</p>
<p>something. It's the easiest thing in the world, like drinking water from&nbsp;</p>
<p>a tap. Before you know it, I've got 'em down. It's what they expect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what I mean by possibility. It's all around you. How can you&nbsp;</p>
<p>ignore it? You have a certain ability and the opportunity to use it: can&nbsp;</p>
<p>you keep your mouth shut and let it pass?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, I've never been in a situation like that," I said with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>42&nbsp;</p>
<p>smile. "I can't imagine what it's like."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Count your blessings," Nagasawa said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His womanizing was the reason Nagasawa lived in a dorm despite his&nbsp;</p>
<p>affluent background. Worried that Nagasawa would do nothing else if&nbsp;</p>
<p>allowed to live alone in Tokyo, his father had compelled him to live&nbsp;</p>
<p>all four years at university in the dormitory. Not that it mattered much&nbsp;</p>
<p>to Nagasawa. He was not going to let a few rules bother him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever he felt like it, he would get an overnight permission and go&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl-hunting or spend the night at his girlfriend's flat. These&nbsp;</p>
<p>permissions were not easy to get, but for him they were like free&nbsp;</p>
<p>passes - and for me, too, as long as he did the asking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa did have a steady girlfriend, one he'd been going out with&nbsp;</p>
<p>since his first year. Her name was Hatsumi, and she was the same age&nbsp;</p>
<p>as Nagasawa. I had met her a few times and found her to be very nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She didn't have the kind of looks that immediately attracted attention,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and in fact she was so ordinary that when I first met her I had to&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonder why Nagasawa couldn't do better, but anyone who talked to&nbsp;</p>
<p>her took an immediate liking to her. Quiet, intelligent, funny, caring,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she always dressed with immaculate good taste. I liked her a lot and&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew that if I could have a girlfriend like Hatsumi, I wouldn't be&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleeping around with a bunch of easy marks. She liked me, too, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried hard to fix me up with a first-year in her club so we could&nbsp;</p>
<p>double-date, but I would make up excuses to keep from repeating past&nbsp;</p>
<p>mistakes. Hatsumi went to the absolute top girls' college in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>country, and there was no way I was going to be able to talk to one of&nbsp;</p>
<p>those super-rich princesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but she never complained to him. She was seriously in love, but she&nbsp;</p>
<p>never made demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't deserve a girl like Hatsumi," Nagasawa once said to me. I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>to agree with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>43&nbsp;</p>
<p>That winter I found a part-time job in a little record shop in Shinjuku.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn't pay much, but the work was easy - just watching the place&nbsp;</p>
<p>three nights a week - and they let me buy records cheap. For&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christmas I bought Naoko a Henry Mancini album with a track of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>favourite "Dear Heart". I wrapped it myself and added a bright red&nbsp;</p>
<p>ribbon. She gave me a pair of woollen gloves she had knitted. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>thumbs were a little short, but they did keep my hands warm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," she said, blushing, "What a bad job!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry, they fit fine," I said, holding my gloved hands out to&nbsp;</p>
<p>her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, at least you won't have to shove your hands in your pockets, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>guess."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko didn't go home to Kobe for the winter break. I stayed in Tokyo,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too, working in the record shop right up to the end of the year. I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have anything especially fun to do in Kobe or anyone I wanted to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dorm's dining hall was closed for the holiday, so I went to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko's flat for meals. On New Year's Eve we had rice cakes and&nbsp;</p>
<p>soup like everybody else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot happened in late January and February that year, 1969.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of January, Storm Trooper went to bed with a raging fever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which meant I had to stand up Naoko that day. I had gone to a lot of&nbsp;</p>
<p>trouble to get my hands on some free tickets for a concert. She had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been especially eager to go because the orchestra was performing one&nbsp;</p>
<p>of her favourites: Brahms' Fourth Symphony. But with Storm Trooper&nbsp;</p>
<p>tossing around in bed on the verge of what looked like an agonizing&nbsp;</p>
<p>death, I couldn't just leave him, and I couldn't find anyone stupid&nbsp;</p>
<p>enough to nurse him in my place. I bought some ice and used several&nbsp;</p>
<p>layers of plastic bags to hold it on his forehead, wiped his sweating&nbsp;</p>
<p>brow with cold towels, took his temperature every hour, and even&nbsp;</p>
<p>changed his vest for him. The fever stayed high for a day, but the&nbsp;</p>
<p>following morning he jumped out of bed and started exercising as&nbsp;</p>
<p>though nothing had happened. His temperature was completely&nbsp;</p>
<p>44&nbsp;</p>
<p>normal. It was hard to believe he was a human being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Weird," said Storm Trooper. "I've never run a fever in my life." It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was almost as if he were blaming me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This made me mad. "But you did have a fever," I insisted, showing&nbsp;</p>
<p>him the two wasted tickets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good thing they were free," he said. I wanted to grab his radio and&nbsp;</p>
<p>throw it out of the window, but instead I went back to bed with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It snowed several times in February.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near the end of the month I got into a stupid fight with one of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>third-years on my floor and punched him. He hit his head against the&nbsp;</p>
<p>concrete wall, but he wasn't badly injured, and Nagasawa straightened&nbsp;</p>
<p>things out for me. Still, I was called into the dorm Head's office and&nbsp;</p>
<p>given a warning, after which I grew increasingly uncomfortable living&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the dormitory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The academic year ended in March, but I came up a few credits short.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My exam results were mediocre - mostly "C"s and "D"s with a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>"B"s. Naoko had all the grades she needed to begin the spring term of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her second year. We had completed one full cycle of the seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Halfway through April Naoko turned 20. She was seven months older&nbsp;</p>
<p>than I was, my own birthday being in November. There was&nbsp;</p>
<p>something strange about her becoming 20. I. felt as if the only thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>that made sense, whether for Naoko or for me, was to keep going back&nbsp;</p>
<p>and forth between 18 and 19. After 18 would come 19, and after 19,&nbsp;</p>
<p>18, of course. But she turned 20. And in the autumn, I would do the&nbsp;</p>
<p>same. Only the dead stay 17 for ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It rained on her birthday. After lectures I bought a cake nearby and&nbsp;</p>
<p>took the tram to her flat. "We ought to have a celebration," I said. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably would have wanted the same thing if our positions had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>reversed. It must be hard to pass your twentieth birthday alone. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>tram had been packed and had pitched so wildly that by the time I&nbsp;</p>
<p>45&nbsp;</p>
<p>arrived at Naoko's room the cake was looking more like the Roman&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colosseum than anything else. Still, once I had managed to stand up&nbsp;</p>
<p>the 20 candles I had brought along, light them, close the curtains and&nbsp;</p>
<p>turn out the lights, we had the makings of a birthday party. Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>opened a bottle of wine. We drank, had some cake, and enjoyed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>simple dinner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, it's stupid being 20," she said. "I'm just not ready. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>feels weird. Like somebody's pushing me from behind."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've got seven months to get ready," I said with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're so lucky! Still 19!" said Naoko with a hint of envy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we ate I told her about Storm Trooper's new jumper. Until then&nbsp;</p>
<p>he had had only one, a navy-blue pullover, so two was a big move for&nbsp;</p>
<p>him. The jumper itself was a nice one, red and black with a knitted&nbsp;</p>
<p>deer motif, but on him it made everybody laugh. He couldn't work out&nbsp;</p>
<p>what was going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"W what's so funny, Watanabe?" he asked, sitting next to me in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dining hall. "Is something stuck to my forehead?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said, trying to keep a straight face. "There's nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>funny. Nice jumper."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks," he said, beaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko loved the story. "I have to meet him," she said. "Just once."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said. "You'd laugh in his face." "You think so?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd bet on it. I see him every day, and still I can't help laughing&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cleared the table and sat on the floor, listening to music and&nbsp;</p>
<p>drinking the rest of the wine. She drank two glasses in the time it took&nbsp;</p>
<p>me to finish one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko was unusually talkative that night. She told me about her&nbsp;</p>
<p>childhood, her school, her family. Each episode was a long one,&nbsp;</p>
<p>executed with the painstaking detail of a miniature. I was amazed at&nbsp;</p>
<p>the power of her memory, but as I sat listening it began to dawn on me&nbsp;</p>
<p>that there was something wrong with the way she was telling these&nbsp;</p>
<p>46&nbsp;</p>
<p>stories: something strange, warped even. Each tale had its own&nbsp;</p>
<p>internal logic, but the link from one to the next was odd. Before you&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew it, story A had turned into story B, which had been contained in&nbsp;</p>
<p>A, and then came C from something in B, with no end in sight. I found&nbsp;</p>
<p>things to say in response at first, but after a while I stopped trying. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>put on a record, and when it ended I lifted the needle and put on&nbsp;</p>
<p>another. After the last record I went back to the first. She only had six.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cycle started with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and&nbsp;</p>
<p>ended with Bill Evans' Waltz for Debbie. Rain fell past the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time moved slowly. Naoko went on talking by herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It eventually dawned on me what was wrong: Naoko was taking great&nbsp;</p>
<p>care as she spoke not to touch on certain things. One of those things&nbsp;</p>
<p>was Kizuki, of course, but there was more than Kizuki. And though&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had certain subjects she was determined to avoid, she went on&nbsp;</p>
<p>endlessly and in incredible detail about the most trivial, inane things. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had never heard her speak with such intensity before, and so I did not&nbsp;</p>
<p>interrupt her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the clock struck eleven, though, I began to feel nervous. She had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been talking non-stop for more than four hours. I had to worry about&nbsp;</p>
<p>the last train, and my midnight curfew. I saw my chance and cut in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Time for the troops to go home," I said, looking at my watch. "Last&nbsp;</p>
<p>train's coming."&nbsp;</p>
<p>My words did not seem to reach her. Or, if they did, she was unable to&nbsp;</p>
<p>grasp their meaning. She clamped her mouth shut for a split second,&nbsp;</p>
<p>then went on with her story. I gave up and, shifting to a more&nbsp;</p>
<p>comfortable position, drank what was left of the second bottle of wine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I had better let her talk herself out. The curfew and the last&nbsp;</p>
<p>train would have to take care of themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She did not go on for long, though. Before I knew it, she had stopped&nbsp;</p>
<p>talking. The ragged end of the last word she spoke seemed to float in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the air, where it had been torn off. She had not actually finished what&nbsp;</p>
<p>she was saying. Her words had simply evaporated. She had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>47&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to go on, but had come up against nothing. Something was gone&nbsp;</p>
<p>now, and I was probably the one who had destroyed it. My words&nbsp;</p>
<p>might have finally reached her, taken their time to be understood, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>obliterated whatever energy it was that had kept her talking so long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lips slightly parted, she turned her half focused eyes on mine. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>looked like some kind of machine that had been humming along until&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone pulled the plug. Her eyes appeared clouded, as if covered by&nbsp;</p>
<p>some thin, translucent membrane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry to interrupt," I said, "but it's getting late, and ..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>One big tear spilled from her eye, ran down her cheek and splattered&nbsp;</p>
<p>onto a record jacket. Once that first tear broke free, the rest followed&nbsp;</p>
<p>in an unbroken stream. Naoko bent forwards on all fours on the floor&nbsp;</p>
<p>and, pressing her palms to the mat, began to cry with the force of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>person vomiting. Never in my life had I seen anyone cry with such&nbsp;</p>
<p>intensity. I reached out and placed a hand on her trembling shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, all but instinctively, I took her in my arms. Pressed against me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>her whole body trembling, she continued to cry without a sound. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>shirt became damp - then soaked - with her tears and hot breath. Soon&nbsp;</p>
<p>her fingers began to move across my back as if in search of&nbsp;</p>
<p>something, some important thing that had always been there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting her weight with my left arm, I used my right hand to&nbsp;</p>
<p>caress her soft, straight hair. And I waited. In that position, I waited&nbsp;</p>
<p>for Naoko to stop crying. And I went on waiting. But Naoko's crying&nbsp;</p>
<p>never stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I slept with Naoko that night. Was it the right thing to do? I can't tell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even now, almost 20 years later, I can't be sure. I suppose I'll never&nbsp;</p>
<p>know. But at the time, it was all I could do. She was in a heightened&nbsp;</p>
<p>state of tension and confusion, and she made it clear she wanted me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>give her release. I turned the lights down and began, one piece at a&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, with the gentlest touch I could manage, to remove her clothes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I undressed. It was warm enough, that rainy April night, for us to&nbsp;</p>
<p>cling to each other's nakedness without a sense of chill. We explored&nbsp;</p>
<p>48&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other's bodies in the darkness without words. I kissed her and&nbsp;</p>
<p>held her soft breasts in my hands. She clutched at my erection. Her&nbsp;</p>
<p>opening was warm and wet and asking for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet, when I went inside her, Naoko tensed with pain. Was this her&nbsp;</p>
<p>first time? I asked, and she nodded. Now it was my turn to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>confused. I had assumed that Naoko had been sleeping with Kizuki all&nbsp;</p>
<p>that time. I went in as far as I could and stayed that way for a long&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, holding Naoko, without moving. And then, as she began to seem&nbsp;</p>
<p>calmer, I allowed myself to move inside her, taking a long time to&nbsp;</p>
<p>come to climax, with slow, gentle movements. Her arms tightened&nbsp;</p>
<p>around me at the end, when at last she broke her silence. Her cry was&nbsp;</p>
<p>the saddest sound of orgasm I had ever heard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When everything had ended, I asked Naoko why she had never slept&nbsp;</p>
<p>with Kizuki. This was a mistake. No sooner had I asked the question&nbsp;</p>
<p>than she took her arms from me and started crying soundlessly again. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>pulled her bedding from the closet, spread it on the mat floor, and put&nbsp;</p>
<p>her in beneath the covers. Smoking, I watched the endless April rain&nbsp;</p>
<p>beyond the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rain had stopped when morning came. Naoko was sleeping with&nbsp;</p>
<p>her back to me. Or maybe she hadn't slept at all. Whether she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>awake or asleep, all words had left her lips, and her body now seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>stiff, almost frozen. I tried several times to talk to her, but she would&nbsp;</p>
<p>not answer or move. I stared for a long time at her naked shoulder, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the end I lost all hope of eliciting a response and decided to get up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The floor was still littered with record jackets, glasses, wine bottles&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the ashtray I had been using. Half the caved-in birthday cake&nbsp;</p>
<p>remained on the table. It was as if time had come to a halt. I picked up&nbsp;</p>
<p>the things off the floor and drank two glasses of water at the sink. On&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko's desk lay a dictionary and a French verb chart. On the wall&nbsp;</p>
<p>above the desk hung a calendar, one without an illustration or photo of&nbsp;</p>
<p>any kind, just the numbers of the days of the month. There were no&nbsp;</p>
<p>memos or marks written next to any of the dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>49&nbsp;</p>
<p>I picked up my clothes and dressed. The chest of my shirt was still&nbsp;</p>
<p>damp and chilly. It had Naoko's smell. On the notepad lying on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>desk I wrote: I'd like to have a good long talk with you once you've&nbsp;</p>
<p>calmed down. Please call me soon. Happy&nbsp;</p>
<p>Birthday. I took one last look at Naoko's shoulder, stepped outside and&nbsp;</p>
<p>quietly shut the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No call came even after a week had passed. Naoko's house had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>system for calling people to the phone, and so on Sunday morning I&nbsp;</p>
<p>took the train out to Kokubunji. She wasn't there, and her name had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been removed from the door. The windows and storm shutters were&nbsp;</p>
<p>closed tight. The manager told me that Naoko had moved out three&nbsp;</p>
<p>days earlier. He had no idea where she had moved to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to the dorm and wrote Naoko a long letter addressed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>her home in Kobe. Wherever she was, they would forward it to her at&nbsp;</p>
<p>least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave her an honest account of my feelings. There was a lot I still&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't understand, I said, and though I was trying hard to understand, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>would take time. Where I would be once that time had gone by, it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>impossible for me to say now, which is why it was impossible for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>to make promises or demands, or to set down pretty words. For one&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing, we knew too little of each other. If, however, she would grant&nbsp;</p>
<p>me the time, I would give it my best effort, and the two of us would&nbsp;</p>
<p>come to know each other better. In any case, I wanted to see her again&nbsp;</p>
<p>and have a good long talk. When I lost Kizuki, I lost the one person to&nbsp;</p>
<p>whom I could speak honestly of my feelings, and I imagined it had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been the same for Naoko. She and I had needed each other more than&nbsp;</p>
<p>either of us knew. Which was no doubt why our relationship had taken&nbsp;</p>
<p>such a major detour and become, in a sense, warped. I probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>should not have done what I did, and yet I believe that it was all I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could do. The warmth and closeness I felt for you at that moment was&nbsp;</p>
<p>something I have never experienced before. I need you to answer this&nbsp;</p>
<p>50&nbsp;</p>
<p>letter. Whatever that answer may be, I need to have it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No answer came.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something inside me had dropped away, and nothing came in to fill&nbsp;</p>
<p>the empty cavern. There was an abnormal lightness to my body, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>sounds had a hollow echo to them. I went to lectures more faithfully&nbsp;</p>
<p>than ever. They were boring, and I never talked to my fellow students,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I had nothing else to do. I would sit by myself in the very front&nbsp;</p>
<p>row of the lecture hall, speak to no one and eat alone. I stopped&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The student strike started at the end of May. "Dismantle the&nbsp;</p>
<p>University!" they all screamed. Go ahead, do it, I thought. Dismantle&nbsp;</p>
<p>it. Tear it apart. Crush it to bits. I don't give a damn. It would be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>breath of fresh air. I'm ready for anything. I'll help if necessary. Just&nbsp;</p>
<p>go ahead and do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the campus blockaded and lectures suspended, I started to work&nbsp;</p>
<p>at a delivery company. Sitting with the driver, loading and unloading&nbsp;</p>
<p>lorries, that kind of stuff. It was tougher than I thought. At first I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>hardly get out of bed in the morning with the pain. The pay was good,&nbsp;</p>
<p>though, and as long as I kept my body moving I could forget about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>emptiness inside. I worked on the lorries five days a week, and three&nbsp;</p>
<p>nights a week I continued my job at the record shop. Nights without&nbsp;</p>
<p>work I spent with whisky and books. Storm Trooper wouldn't touch&nbsp;</p>
<p>whisky and couldn't stand the smell, so when I was sprawled on my&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed drinking it straight, he'd complain that the fumes made it&nbsp;</p>
<p>impossible for him to study and ask me to take my bottle outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You get the hell out," I growled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you know drinking in the dorm is a-a-against the rules."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't give a shit. You get out."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He stopped complaining, but now I was annoyed. I went to the roof&nbsp;</p>
<p>and drank alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June I wrote Naoko another long letter, addressing it again to her&nbsp;</p>
<p>house in Kobe. It said pretty much the same thing as the first one, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>51&nbsp;</p>
<p>at the end I added: Waiting for your&nbsp;</p>
<p>answer is one of the most painful things I have ever been through. At&nbsp;</p>
<p>least let me know whether or not I hurt you. When I posted it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt as if the cavern inside me had grown again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That June I went out with Nagasawa twice again to sleep with girls. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was easy both times. The first girl put up a terrific struggle when I&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried to get her undressed and into the hotel bed, but when I began&nbsp;</p>
<p>reading alone because it just wasn't worth it, she came over and started&nbsp;</p>
<p>nuzzling me. And after I had done it with the second one, she started&nbsp;</p>
<p>asking me all kinds of personal questions - how many girls had I slept&nbsp;</p>
<p>with? Where was I from? Which university did I go to? What kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>music did I like? Had I ever read any novels by Osamu Dazai? Where&nbsp;</p>
<p>would I like to go if I could travel abroad? Did I think her nipples&nbsp;</p>
<p>were too big? I made up some answers and went to sleep, but next&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning she said she wanted to have breakfast with me, and she kept&nbsp;</p>
<p>up the stream of questions&nbsp;</p>
<p>over the tasteless eggs and toast and coffee. What kind of work did my&nbsp;</p>
<p>father do? Did I get good marks at school? What month was I born?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had I ever eaten frogs? She was giving me a headache, so as soon as&nbsp;</p>
<p>we had finished eating I said I had to go to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Will I ever see you again?" she asked with a sad look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere before long," I said, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>left. What the hell am I doing? I started wondering as soon as I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>alone, feeling disgusted with myself. And yet it was all I could do. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>body was hungering for women. All the time I was sleeping with&nbsp;</p>
<p>those girls I thought about Naoko: the white shape of her naked body&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the darkness, her sighs, the sound of the rain. The more I thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about these things, the hungrier my body grew. I went up to the roof&nbsp;</p>
<p>with my whisky and asked myself where I thought I was heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, at the beginning of July, a letter came from Naoko. A short&nbsp;</p>
<p>letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>52&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please forgive me for not answering sooner. But try to understand. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>took me a very long time before I was in any condition to write, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>have started this letter at least ten times. Writing is a painful process&nbsp;</p>
<p>for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me begin with my conclusion. I have decided to take a year off&nbsp;</p>
<p>from college. Officially, it's a leave of absence, but I suspect that I will&nbsp;</p>
<p>never be going back. This will no doubt come as a surprise to you, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>in fact I had been thinking about doing this for a very long time. I tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>a few times to mention it to you, but I was never able to make myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>begin. I was afraid even to pronounce the words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try not to get so worked up about things. Whatever happened - or&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't happen - the end result would have been the same. This may not&nbsp;</p>
<p>be the best way to put it, and I'm sorry if it hurts you. What I am&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to tell you is, I don't want you to blame yourself for what&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened with me. It is something I have to take on all by myself. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been putting it off for more than a year, and so I ended up making&nbsp;</p>
<p>things very difficult for you. There is probably no way to put it off any&nbsp;</p>
<p>longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I moved out of my flat, I came back to my family's house in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kobe and was seeing a doctor for a while. He tells me there is a place&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the hills outside Kyoto that would be perfect for me, and I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>thinking of spending a little time there. It's not exactly a hospital, more&nbsp;</p>
<p>a sanatorium kind of thing with a far freer style of treatment. I'll leave&nbsp;</p>
<p>the details for another letter. What I need now is to rest my nerves in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>quiet place cut off from the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel grateful in my own way for the year of companionship you gave&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. Please believe that much even if you believe nothing else. You are&nbsp;</p>
<p>not the one who hurt me. I myself am the one who did that. This is&nbsp;</p>
<p>truly how I feel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, however, I am not prepared to see you. It's not that I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to see you: I'm simply not prepared for it. The moment I feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>ready, I will write to you. Perhaps then we can get to know each other&nbsp;</p>
<p>53&nbsp;</p>
<p>better. As you say, this is probably what we should do: get to know&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read Naoko's letter again and again, and each time I would be filled&nbsp;</p>
<p>with that same unbearable sadness I used to feel whenever Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>herself stared into my eyes. I had no way to deal with it, no place I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could take it to or hide it away. Like the wind passing over my body,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it had neither shape nor weight nor could I wrap myself in it. Objects&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the scene would drift past me, but the words they spoke never&nbsp;</p>
<p>reached my ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I continued to spend my Saturday nights sitting in the hall. There was&nbsp;</p>
<p>no hope of a phone call, but I didn't know what else to do with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>time. I would switch on a baseball game and pretend to watch it as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>cut the empty space between me and the television set in two, then cut&nbsp;</p>
<p>each half in two again, over and over, until I had fashioned a space&nbsp;</p>
<p>small enough to hold in my hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would switch the set off at ten, go back to my room, and go to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the month, Storm Trooper gave me a firefly. It was in an&nbsp;</p>
<p>instant coffee jar with air holes in the lid and containing some blades&nbsp;</p>
<p>of grass and a little water. In the bright room the firefly looked like&nbsp;</p>
<p>some kind of ordinary black insect you'd find by a pond somewhere,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but Storm Trooper insisted it was the real thing. "I know a firefly&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I see one," he said, and I had no reason or basis to disbelieve&nbsp;</p>
<p>him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," I said. "It's a firefly." It had a sleepy look on its face, but it&nbsp;</p>
<p>kept trying to climb up the slippery glass walls of the jar and falling&nbsp;</p>
<p>back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I found it in the quad," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Here? By the dorm?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. You know the hotel down the street? They release fireflies in&nbsp;</p>
<p>54&nbsp;</p>
<p>their garden for summer guests. This one made it over here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storm Trooper was busy stuffing clothes and notebooks into his black&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boston bag as he spoke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were several weeks into the summer holidays, and he and I were&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost the only ones left in the dorm. I had carried on with my jobs&nbsp;</p>
<p>rather than go back to Kobe, and he had stayed on for a practical&nbsp;</p>
<p>training session. Now that the training had ended, he was going back&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the mountains of Yamanashi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You could give this to your girlfriend," he said. "I'm sure she'd love&nbsp;</p>
<p>it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dark the dorm was hushed, like a ruin. The flag had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>lowered and the lights glowed in the windows of the dining hall. With&nbsp;</p>
<p>so few students left, they turned on only half the lights in the place,&nbsp;</p>
<p>keeping the right half dark and the left lighted. Still, the smell of&nbsp;</p>
<p>dinner drifted up to me - some kind of cream stew.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took my bottled firefly to the roof. No one else was up there. A white&nbsp;</p>
<p>vest hung on a clothesline that someone had forgotten to take in,&nbsp;</p>
<p>waving in the evening breeze like the discarded shell of some huge&nbsp;</p>
<p>insect. I climbed a steel ladder in the corner of the roof to the top of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the dormitory's water tank. The tank was still warm with the heat of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sunlight it had absorbed during the day. I sat in the narrow space&nbsp;</p>
<p>above the tank, leaning against the handrail and coming face-to-face&nbsp;</p>
<p>with an almost full white moon. The lights of Shinjuku glowed to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>right, Ikebukuro to the left. Car headlights flowed in brilliant streams&nbsp;</p>
<p>from one pool of light to the other. A dull roar of jumbled sounds&nbsp;</p>
<p>hung over the city like a cloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firefly made a faint glow in the bottom of the jar, its light all too&nbsp;</p>
<p>weak, its colour all too pale. I hadn't seen a firefly in years, but the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ones in my memory sent a far more intense light into the summer&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness, and that brilliant, burning image was the one that had stayed&nbsp;</p>
<p>with me all that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>55&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this firefly was on the verge of death. I gave the jar a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>shakes. The firefly bumped against the glass walls and tried to fly, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>its light remained dim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to remember when I had last seen fireflies, and where it might&nbsp;</p>
<p>have been. I could see the scene in my mind, but was unable to recall&nbsp;</p>
<p>the time or place. I could hear the sound of water in the darkness and&nbsp;</p>
<p>see an old-fashioned brick sluice gate. It had a handle you could turn&nbsp;</p>
<p>to open and close the gate. The stream it controlled was small enough&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be hidden by the grass on its banks. The night was dark, so dark I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't see my feet when I turned out my torch. Hundreds of fireflies&nbsp;</p>
<p>drifted over the pool of water held back by the sluice gate, their hot&nbsp;</p>
<p>glow reflected in the water like a shower of sparks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and steeped myself in that long-ago darkness. I heard&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wind with unusual clarity. A light breeze swept past me, leaving&nbsp;</p>
<p>strangely brilliant trails in the dark. I opened my eyes to find the&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness of the summer night a few degrees deeper than it had been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I twisted open the lid of the jar and took out the firefly, setting it on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the two-inch lip of the water tank. It seemed not to grasp its new&nbsp;</p>
<p>surroundings. It hobbled around the head of a steel bolt, catching its&nbsp;</p>
<p>legs on curling scabs of paint. It moved to the right until it found its&nbsp;</p>
<p>way blocked, then circled back to the left. Finally, with some effort, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>mounted the head of the bolt and crouched there for a while,&nbsp;</p>
<p>unmoving, as if it had taken its last breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still leaning against the handrail, I studied the firefly. Neither I nor it&nbsp;</p>
<p>made a move for a very long time. The wind continued sweeping past&nbsp;</p>
<p>the two of us while the numberless leaves of the zelkova tree rustled&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the darkness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waited for ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only much later did the firefly take to the air. As if some thought had&nbsp;</p>
<p>suddenly occurred to it, the firefly spread its wings, and in a moment&nbsp;</p>
<p>56&nbsp;</p>
<p>it had flown past the handrail to float in the pale darkness. It traced a&nbsp;</p>
<p>swift arc by the side of the water tank as though trying to bring back a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lost interval in time. And then, after hovering there for a few seconds&nbsp;</p>
<p>as if to watch its curved line of light blend into the wind, it finally&nbsp;</p>
<p>flew off to the east.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long after the firefly had disappeared, the trail of its light remained&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside me, its pale, faint glow hovering on and on in the thick darkness&nbsp;</p>
<p>behind my eyelids like a lost soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than once I tried stretching my hand out in the dark. My fingers&nbsp;</p>
<p>touched nothing. The faint glow remained, just beyond my grasp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>57&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the summer holidays the university called in the riot police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They broke down the barricades and arrested the students inside. This&nbsp;</p>
<p>was nothing new. It's what all the students were doing at the time. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>universities were not so easily "dismantled". Massive amounts of&nbsp;</p>
<p>capital had been invested in them, and they were not about to dissolve&nbsp;</p>
<p>just because a few students had gone wild. And in fact those students&nbsp;</p>
<p>who had sealed off the campus had not wanted to dismantle the&nbsp;</p>
<p>university either. All they had really wanted to do was shift the&nbsp;</p>
<p>balance of power within the university structure, about which I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't have cared less. And so, when the strike was finally crushed, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>felt nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the campus in September expecting to find rubble. The place&nbsp;</p>
<p>was untouched. The library's books had not been carted off, the tutors'&nbsp;</p>
<p>offices had not been destroyed, the student affairs office had not been&nbsp;</p>
<p>burned to the ground. I was thunderstruck. What the hell had they&nbsp;</p>
<p>been doing behind the barricades?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the strike was defused and lectures started up again under&nbsp;</p>
<p>police occupation, the first ones to take their seats in the classrooms&nbsp;</p>
<p>were those arseholes who had led the strike. As if nothing had ever&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened, they sat there taking notes and answering "present" when&nbsp;</p>
<p>the register was taken. I found this incredible. After all, the strike was&nbsp;</p>
<p>still in effect. There had been no declaration bringing it to an end. All&nbsp;</p>
<p>that had happened was that the university had called in the riot police&nbsp;</p>
<p>and torn down the barricades, but the strike itself was supposed to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>58&nbsp;</p>
<p>continuing. The arseholes had screamed their heads off at the time of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the strike, denouncing students who opposed it (or just expressed&nbsp;</p>
<p>doubts about it), at times even trying them in their own kangaroo&nbsp;</p>
<p>courts. I made a point of visiting those former leaders and asking why&nbsp;</p>
<p>they were attending lectures instead of continuing to strike, but they&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't give me a straight answer. What could they have said? That&nbsp;</p>
<p>they were afraid of losing marks through lack of attendance? To think&nbsp;</p>
<p>that these idiots had been the ones screaming for the dismantling of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the university! What a joke. The wind changes direction a little, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>their cries become whispers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, Kizuki, I thought, you're not missing a damn thing. This world is&nbsp;</p>
<p>a piece of shit. The arseholes are getting good marks and helping to&nbsp;</p>
<p>create a society in their own disgusting image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a while I attended lectures but refused to answer when they took&nbsp;</p>
<p>the register. I knew it was a pointless gesture, but I felt so bad I had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>choice. All I managed to do was isolate myself more than ever from&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other students. By remaining silent when my name was called, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>made everyone uncomfortable for a few seconds. None of the other&nbsp;</p>
<p>students spoke to me, and I spoke to none of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the second week in September I reached the conclusion that a&nbsp;</p>
<p>university education was meaningless. I decided to think of it as a&nbsp;</p>
<p>period of training in techniques for dealing with boredom. I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing I especially wanted to accomplish in society that would&nbsp;</p>
<p>require me to abandon my studies straight away, and so I went to my&nbsp;</p>
<p>lectures each day, took notes, and spent my free time in the library&nbsp;</p>
<p>reading or looking&nbsp;</p>
<p>things up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And though that second week in September had rolled around, there&nbsp;</p>
<p>was no sign of Storm Trooper. More than unusual, this was an earth</p>
<p>shattering development. University had started up again, and it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>inconceivable that Storm Trooper would miss lectures. A thin layer of&nbsp;</p>
<p>59&nbsp;</p>
<p>dust covered his desk and radio. His plastic cup and toothbrush, tea&nbsp;</p>
<p>tin, insecticide spray and so on stood in a neat row on his shelf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kept the room clean in his absence. I had picked up the habit of&nbsp;</p>
<p>neatness over the past year and a half, and without him there to take&nbsp;</p>
<p>care of the room, I had no choice but to do it. I swept the floor each&nbsp;</p>
<p>day, wiped the window every third day, and aired my mattress once a&nbsp;</p>
<p>week, waiting for him to come back and tell me what a great job I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he never came back. I returned from lectures one day to find all&nbsp;</p>
<p>his stuff gone and his name tag removed from the door. I went to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm Head's room and asked what had happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's withdrawn from the dormitory," he said. "You'll be alone in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>room for the time being."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't get him to tell me why Storm Trooper had disappeared. This&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a man whose greatest joy in life was to control everything and&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep others in the dark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storm Trooper's iceberg poster stayed on the wall for a time, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>eventually took it down and replaced it with Jim Morrison and Miles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis. This made the room seem a little more like my own. I used&nbsp;</p>
<p>some of the money I had saved from work to buy a small stereo. At&nbsp;</p>
<p>night I would drink alone and listen to music. I thought about Storm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trooper every now and then, but I enjoyed living alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 11.30 a.m. one Monday, after a lecture on Euripides in History of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drama, I took a ten-minute walk to a little restaurant and had an&nbsp;</p>
<p>omelette and salad for lunch. The place was on a quiet backstreet and&nbsp;</p>
<p>was slightly more expensive than the student dining hall, but you&nbsp;</p>
<p>could relax there, and they knew how to make a good omelette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They" were a married couple who rarely spoke to each other, plus&nbsp;</p>
<p>one part-time waitress. As I sat there eating by the window, a group of&nbsp;</p>
<p>four students came in, two men and two women, all rather neatly&nbsp;</p>
<p>dressed. They took the table near the door, spent some time looking&nbsp;</p>
<p>60&nbsp;</p>
<p>over the menu and discussing their options, until one of them reported&nbsp;</p>
<p>their choices to the waitress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before long I noticed that one of the girls kept glancing in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>direction. She had extremely short hair and wore dark sunglasses and&nbsp;</p>
<p>a white cotton mini-dress. I had no idea who she was, so I went on&nbsp;</p>
<p>with my lunch, but she soon slipped out of her seat and came over to&nbsp;</p>
<p>where I was sitting. With one hand on the edge of my table, she said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're Watanabe, aren't you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I raised my head and looked at her more closely. Still I could not&nbsp;</p>
<p>recall ever having seen her. She was the kind of girl you notice, so if I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had met her before I should have been able to recognize her&nbsp;</p>
<p>immediately, and there weren't that many people in my university who&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew me by name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Mind if I sit down?" she asked. "Or are you expecting somebody?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still uncertain, I shook my head. "No, nobody's coming. Please."&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a wooden clunk, she dragged a chair out and sat down opposite,&nbsp;</p>
<p>staring straight at me through her sunglasses, then&nbsp;</p>
<p>glancing at my plate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Looks good," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is good. Mushroom omelette and green pea salad." "Damn," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "Oh, well, I'll get it next time. I've&nbsp;</p>
<p>already ordered something else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What are you having?" "Macaroni and cheese."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Their macaroni and cheese isn't bad, either," I said. "By the way, do I&nbsp;</p>
<p>know you? I don't recall. .."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Euripides," she said. "Electra. "No god hearkens to the voice of lost&nbsp;</p>
<p>Electra.' You know - the class just ended."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stared hard at her. She took off her sunglasses. At last I remembered&nbsp;</p>
<p>her - a first-year I had seen in History of Drama. A striking change in&nbsp;</p>
<p>hairstyle had prevented me recognizing her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh," I said, touching a point a few inches below my shoulder, "your&nbsp;</p>
<p>hair was down to here before the summer holidays." "You're right,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>61&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said. "I had a perm this summer, and it was just awful. I was ready&nbsp;</p>
<p>to kill myself. I looked like a corpse on the beach with seaweed stuck&nbsp;</p>
<p>to my head. So I decided as long as I was ready to die, I might as well&nbsp;</p>
<p>cut it all off. At least it's cool in the summer." She ran her hand&nbsp;</p>
<p>through her pixie cut and gave me a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It looks good, though," I said, still munching my omelette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let me see your profile."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She turned away and held the pose a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I thought so. It really looks good on you. Nicely shaped head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty ears, too, uncovered like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So I'm not mad after all! I thought I looked good myself once I cut it&nbsp;</p>
<p>all off. Not one guy likes it, though. They all tell me I look like a&nbsp;</p>
<p>concentration camp survivor. What's this thing that guys have for girls&nbsp;</p>
<p>with long hair? Fascists, the whole bunch of them! Why do guys all&nbsp;</p>
<p>think girls with long hair are the classiest, the sweetest, the most&nbsp;</p>
<p>feminine? I mean, I myself know at least 250 unclassy girls with long&nbsp;</p>
<p>hair. Really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think you look better now than you did before," I said. And I meant&nbsp;</p>
<p>it. As far as I could recall, with long hair she had been just another&nbsp;</p>
<p>cute student. A fresh and physical life force surged from the girl who&nbsp;</p>
<p>sat before me now. She was like a small animal that has popped into&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world with the coming of spring. Her eyes moved like an&nbsp;</p>
<p>independent organism with joy, laughter, anger, amazement and&nbsp;</p>
<p>despair. I hadn't seen a face so vivid and expressive in ages, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed watching it live and move.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you mean it?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded, still munching on my salad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She put on her sunglasses and looked at me from behind them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're not lying, are you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like to think of myself as an honest man," I said. "Far out."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So tell me: why do you wear such dark glasses?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I felt defenceless when my hair got short all of a sudden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>62&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if somebody had thrown me into a crowd all naked." "Makes&nbsp;</p>
<p>sense," I said, eating the last of my omelette. She watched me with&nbsp;</p>
<p>intense interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You don't have to go back to them?" I asked, indicating her three&nbsp;</p>
<p>companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah. I'll go back when they serve the food. Am I interrupting your&nbsp;</p>
<p>meal?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's nothing left to interrupt," I said, ordering coffee when she&nbsp;</p>
<p>showed no sign of leaving. The wife took my dishes and brought milk&nbsp;</p>
<p>and sugar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now you tell me," she said. "Why didn't you answer today when they&nbsp;</p>
<p>called the register? You are Watanabe, aren't you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toru Watanabe?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So why didn't you answer?" "I just didn't feel like it today."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She took off her sunglasses again, set them on the table, and looked at&nbsp;</p>
<p>me as if she were staring into the cage of some rare animal at a zoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I just didn't feel like it today." You talk like Humphrey Bogart. Cool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tough."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be silly. I'm just an ordinary guy like everybody else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wife brought my coffee and set it on the table. I took a sip without&nbsp;</p>
<p>adding sugar or milk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look at that. You drink it black."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's got nothing to do with Humphrey Bogart," I explained patiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I just don't happen to have a sweet tooth. I think you've got me all&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrong."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why are you so tanned?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've been hiking around the last couple of weeks. Rucksack. Sleeping&nbsp;</p>
<p>bag."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where'd you go?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Kanazawa. Noto Peninsula. Up to Niigata." "Alone?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Alone," I said. "Found some company here and there." "Some&nbsp;</p>
<p>63&nbsp;</p>
<p>romantic company? New women in far-off places." "Romantic? Now I&nbsp;</p>
<p>know you've got me wrong. How's a guy with a sleeping bag on his&nbsp;</p>
<p>back and his face all stubbly supposed to have romance?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you always travel alone like that?" "Uh-huh."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You enjoy solitude?" she asked, resting her cheek on her hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Travelling alone, eating alone, sitting by yourself in lecture halls ..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nobody likes being alone that much. I don't go out of my way to&nbsp;</p>
<p>make friends, that's all. It just leads to disappointment."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tip of one earpiece in her mouth, sunglasses dangling down, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>mumbled, ""Nobody likes being alone. I just hate to be disappointed.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use that line if you ever write your autobiography."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you like green?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're wearing a green polo shirt."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not especially. I'll wear anything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Not especially. I'll wear anything.' I love the way you talk. Like&nbsp;</p>
<p>spreading plaster, nice and smooth. Has anybody ever told you that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nobody," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My name's Midori," she said. ""Green'. But green looks terrible on&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. Weird, huh? It's like I'm cursed, don't you think? My sister's name&nbsp;</p>
<p>is Momoko: "Peach girl'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does she look good in pink?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She looks great in pink! She was born to wear pink. It's totally&nbsp;</p>
<p>unfair."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The food arrived at Midori's table, and a guy in a madras jacket called&nbsp;</p>
<p>out to her, "Hey, Midori, come 'n' get it!" She waved at him as if to&nbsp;</p>
<p>say "I know".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me," she said. "Do you take lecture notes? In drama?" "I do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hate to ask, but could I borrow your notes? I've missed twice, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't know anybody in the class." "No problem," I said, pulling the&nbsp;</p>
<p>notebook from my bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>64&nbsp;</p>
<p>After checking to make sure I hadn't written anything personal in it, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>handed it to Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks," she said. "Are you coming to lectures the day after&nbsp;</p>
<p>tomorrow?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Meet me here at noon. I'll give you back your notebook and buy you&nbsp;</p>
<p>lunch. I mean ... it's not as if you get an upset stomach or anything if&nbsp;</p>
<p>you don't eat alone, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No," I said. "But you don't have to buy me lunch just because I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>lending you my notebook."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry," she said. "I like buying people lunch. Anyway,&nbsp;</p>
<p>shouldn't you write it down somewhere? You won't forget?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I won't forget. Day after tomorrow. Twelve o'clock. Midori. Green."&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the other table, somebody called out, "Hurry up, Midori, your&nbsp;</p>
<p>food's getting cold!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>She ignored the call and asked me, "Have you always talked like&nbsp;</p>
<p>that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think so," I said. "Never noticed before." And in fact no one had&nbsp;</p>
<p>ever told me there was anything unusual about the way I spoke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She seemed to be mulling something over for a few seconds. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>stood up with a smile and went back to her table. She waved to me as&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walked past their table, but the three others barely glanced in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At noon on Wednesday there was no sign of Midori in the restaurant. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought I might wait for her over a beer, but the place started to fill up&nbsp;</p>
<p>as soon as the drink arrived, so I ordered lunch and ate alone. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>finished at 12.35, but still no Midori. Paying my bill, I went outside&nbsp;</p>
<p>and crossed the street to a little shrine, where I waited on the stone&nbsp;</p>
<p>steps for my head to clear and Midori to come. I gave up at one&nbsp;</p>
<p>o'clock and went to read in the library. At two I went to my German&nbsp;</p>
<p>65&nbsp;</p>
<p>lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it was over I went to the student affairs office and looked for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's name in the class list for History of Drama. The only Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the class was Midori Kobayashi. Next I flipped through the cards of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the student files and found the address and phone number of a Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kobayashi who had entered the university in 1969. She lived in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>north-west suburb, Toshima, with her family. I slipped into a phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>box and dialled the number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man answered: "Kobayashi Bookshop." Kobayashi Bookshop?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry to bother you," I said, "but I wonder if Midori might be in?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, she's not," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you think she might be on campus?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm, no, she's probably at the hospital. Who's calling, please?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of answering, I thanked him and hung up. The hospital? Could&nbsp;</p>
<p>she have been injured or fallen ill? But the man had spoken without&nbsp;</p>
<p>the least sense of emergency. "She's probably at the hospital," he had&nbsp;</p>
<p>said, as easily as he might have said "She's at the fish shop". I thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about a few other possibilities until thinking itself became too&nbsp;</p>
<p>problematic, then I went back to the dorm and stretched out on my bed&nbsp;</p>
<p>reading Lord Jim, which I'd borrowed from Nagasawa. When I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>finished it, I went to his room to give it back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa was on his way to the dining hall, so I went with him for&nbsp;</p>
<p>dinner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How'd the exams go?" I asked. The second round of upper level&nbsp;</p>
<p>exams for the Foreign Ministry had been held in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Same as always," said Nagasawa as if it had been nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You take 'em, you pass. Group discussions, interviews ... like&nbsp;</p>
<p>screwin' a chick."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"In other words, easy," I said. "When do they let you know?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"First week of October. If I pass, I'll buy you a big dinner."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So tell me, what kind of guys make it to round two? All superstars&nbsp;</p>
<p>66&nbsp;</p>
<p>like you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be stupid. They're a bunch of idiots. Idiots or weirdos. I'd say&nbsp;</p>
<p>95 per cent of the guys who want to be bureaucrats aren't worth shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not kidding. They can barely read."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So why are you trying to join the Foreign Ministry?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All kinds of reasons," said Nagasawa. "I like the idea of working&nbsp;</p>
<p>overseas, for one. But mainly I want to test my abilities. If I'm going&nbsp;</p>
<p>to test myself, I want to do it in the biggest field there is - the nation. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to see how high I can climb, how much power I can exercise in&nbsp;</p>
<p>this insanely huge bureaucratic system. Know what I mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds like a game."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is a game. I don't give a damn about power and money per se.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really, I don't. I may be a selfish bastard, but I'm incredibly cool&nbsp;</p>
<p>about shit like that. I could be a Zen saint. The one thing I do have,&nbsp;</p>
<p>though, is curiosity. I want to see what I can do out there in the big,&nbsp;</p>
<p>tough world."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you have no use for "ideals', I suppose?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"None. Life doesn't require ideals. It requires standards of action."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But there are lots of other ways to live, aren't there?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You like the way I live, don't you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's beside the point," I said. "I could never get into Tokyo&nbsp;</p>
<p>University; I can't sleep with any girl I want whenever I want to; I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>no great talker; people don't look up to me; I haven't got a girlfriend;&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the future's not going to open up to me when I get a literature BA&nbsp;</p>
<p>from a second-rate private university. What does it matter if I like the&nbsp;</p>
<p>way you live?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you saying you envy the way I live?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I don't," I said. "I'm too used to being who I am. And I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>really give a damn about Tokyo University or the Foreign Ministry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I envy you for is having a terrific girlfriend like&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa shut up and ate. When dinner was over he said, "You know,&nbsp;</p>
<p>67&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watanabe, I have this feeling like, maybe 10 years or 20 years after&nbsp;</p>
<p>we get out of this place, we're going to meet again somewhere. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>one way or another, I think we're going to have some connection."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds like Dickens," I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess it does," he said, smiling back. "But my hunches are usually&nbsp;</p>
<p>right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two of us left the dining hall and went out to a bar. We stayed&nbsp;</p>
<p>there drinking until after nine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, Nagasawa," I asked, "what is the "standard of action' in your&nbsp;</p>
<p>life?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You'll laugh if I tell you," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No I won't."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "To be a gentleman."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't laugh, but I nearly fell off my chair. "To be a gentleman? A&nbsp;</p>
<p>gentleman?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You heard me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What does it mean to be a gentleman? How do you define it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do but what&nbsp;</p>
<p>he should do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're the weirdest guy I've ever met," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're the straightest guy I've ever met," he said. And he paid for us&nbsp;</p>
<p>both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the following week's drama lecture, but still saw no sign of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori Kobayashi. After a quick survey of the room convinced me she&nbsp;</p>
<p>wasn't there, I took my usual seat in the front row and wrote a letter to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko while I waited for the lecturer to arrive. I wrote about my&nbsp;</p>
<p>summer travels - the roads I had walked, the towns I had passed&nbsp;</p>
<p>through, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>people I had met. And every night I thought of you. Now that I can no&nbsp;</p>
<p>longer see you, I realize how much I need you. University is incredibly&nbsp;</p>
<p>boring, but as a matter of self-discipline I am going to all my lectures&nbsp;</p>
<p>68&nbsp;</p>
<p>and doing all the assignments. Everything seems pointless since you&nbsp;</p>
<p>left. I'd like to have a nice, long talk with you. If possible, I'd like to&nbsp;</p>
<p>visit your sanatorium and see you for several hours. And, if possible,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to go out walking with you side by side the way we used to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to answer this letter - even a short note. I won't mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I filled four sheets, folded them, slipped them into an envelope, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>addressed it to Naoko care of her family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By then the lecturer had arrived, wiping the sweat from his brow as he&nbsp;</p>
<p>took the register. He was a small, mournfullooking man who walked&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a metal cane. While not exactly fun, the lectures in his course&nbsp;</p>
<p>were always well prepared and worthwhile. After remarking that the&nbsp;</p>
<p>weather was as hot as ever, he began to talk about the use of the deus&nbsp;</p>
<p>ex machina in Euripides and explained how the concept of "god" was&nbsp;</p>
<p>different in Euripides than in Aeschylus or Sophocles. He had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>talking for some 15 minutes when the lecture-hall door opened and in&nbsp;</p>
<p>walked Midori. She was wearing a dark blue sports shirt, cream</p>
<p>coloured cotton&nbsp; trousers and her usual sunglasses. After flashing a&nbsp;</p>
<p>"sorry I'm late" kind of smile at the professor, she sat down next to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. Then she took a notebook - my notebook - from her shoulder bag,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and handed it to me. Inside, I found a note: Sorry about Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you angry?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lecture was about half over and the professor was drawing a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sketch of a Greek stage on the blackboard when the door opened again&nbsp;</p>
<p>and two students in helmets walked in. They looked like some kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>comedy team, one tall, thin and pale, the other short, round and dark&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a long beard that didn't suit him. The tall one carried an armful of&nbsp;</p>
<p>political agitation handbills. The short one walked up to the professor&nbsp;</p>
<p>and said, with a degree of politeness, that they would like to use the&nbsp;</p>
<p>second half of his lecture for political debate and hoped that he would&nbsp;</p>
<p>cooperate, adding, "The world is full of problems far more urgent and&nbsp;</p>
<p>relevant than Greek tragedy." This was more an announcement than a&nbsp;</p>
<p>request. The professor replied, "I rather doubt that the world has&nbsp;</p>
<p>69&nbsp;</p>
<p>problems far more urgent and relevant than Greek tragedy, but you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>not going to listen to anything I have to say, so do what you like."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grasping the edge of the table, he set his feet on the floor, picked up&nbsp;</p>
<p>his cane and limped out of the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the tall student passed out his handbills, the round one went to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the podium and started lecturing. The handbills were full of the usual&nbsp;</p>
<p>simplistic sloganeering: "SMASH&nbsp;</p>
<p>FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS FOR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT!",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"MARSHAL ALL FORCES FOR NEW ALL-CAMPUS STRIKE!",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"CRUSH THE IMPERIAL-EDUCATIONAL-INDUSTRIAL&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMPLEX!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no problem with what they were saying, but the writing was&nbsp;</p>
<p>lame. It had nothing to inspire confidence or arouse the passions. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>the round man's speech was just as bad - the same old tune with&nbsp;</p>
<p>different words. The true enemy of this bunch was not State Power but&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lack of Imagination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's get out of here," said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded and stood, and the two of us made for the door. The round&nbsp;</p>
<p>man said something to me at that point, but I couldn't catch it. Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>waved to him and said, "See ya later."&nbsp;</p>
<p>,Hey, are we counter-revolutionaries?" Midori asked me when we&nbsp;</p>
<p>were outside. "Are we going to be strung upon telephone poles if the&nbsp;</p>
<p>revolution succeeds?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's have lunch first, just in case."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good. There's a place I want to take you to. It's a bit far, though. Can&nbsp;</p>
<p>you spare the time?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm free until my two o'clock class."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori took me by bus to Yotsuya and showed me to a fancy boxed</p>
<p>lunch speciality shop in a sheltered spot just behind the station. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>minute we sat down they served us soup and the lunch of the day in&nbsp;</p>
<p>square, red-lacquered boxes. This was a place worth a bus ride to eat&nbsp;</p>
<p>at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>70&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great food," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And cheap, too. I've been coming here since school. My old school's&nbsp;</p>
<p>just down the street. They were so strict, we had to sneak out to eat&nbsp;</p>
<p>here. They'd suspend you if they caught you eating out."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the sunglasses, Midori's eyes looked somewhat sleepier than&nbsp;</p>
<p>they had the last time. When she was not playing with the narrow&nbsp;</p>
<p>silver bracelet on her left wrist, she would be rubbing at the corners of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her eyes with the tip of her little finger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tired?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Kind of. I'm not getting enough sleep. But I'm OK, don't worry," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "Sorry about the other day. Something important came up and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>just couldn't get out of it. All of a sudden, in the morning. I thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about calling you at the restaurant, but I couldn't remember the name,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I didn't know your home number. Did you wait long?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No big deal. I've got a lot of time on my hands."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Way more than I need. I wish I could give you some to help you&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori rested her cheek on her hand and smiled at me. "What a nice&nbsp;</p>
<p>guy you are."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not nice. I just have time to kill," I said. "By the way, I called your&nbsp;</p>
<p>house that day and somebody told me you were at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something wrong?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You called my house?" she asked with a slight wrinkle forming&nbsp;</p>
<p>between her eyebrows. "How did you get my number?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Looked it up in the student affairs office. Anyone can do that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She nodded once or twice and started playing with the bracelet again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I never would have thought of that. I suppose I could have looked up&nbsp;</p>
<p>your number. Anyway, about the hospital, I'll tell you next time. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't feel like it now. Sorry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK. I didn't mean to pry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, you're not prying. I'm just kind of tired. Like a monkey in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>71&nbsp;</p>
<p>rain."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you go home and get some sleep?" "Not now. Let's get out&nbsp;</p>
<p>of here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She took me to her old school, a short walk from Yotsuya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passing the station, I thought about Naoko and our endless walking. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>had all started from there. I realized that if I hadn't run into Naoko on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the train that Sunday in May, My life would have been very different&nbsp;</p>
<p>from what it was now. But then I changed my mind: no, even if we&nbsp;</p>
<p>hadn't met that day, my life might not have been any different. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>were supposed to meet. If not then, some other time. I didn't have any&nbsp;</p>
<p>basis for thinking this: it was just a feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori Kobayashi and I sat on a park bench together, looking at her&nbsp;</p>
<p>old school. Ivy clung to the walls, and pigeons huddled under the&nbsp;</p>
<p>gables, resting their wings. It was a nice, old building with character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great oak tree stood in the playground, and a column of white&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoke rose straight up beside it. The fading summer light gave the&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoke a soft and cloudy look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you know what that smoke is?" Midori asked me all of a sudden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No idea," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They're burning sanitary towels."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?" I couldn't think of anything else to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sanitary towels, tampons, stuff like that," she said with a smile. "It is&nbsp;</p>
<p>a girls' school. The old caretaker collects them from all the receptacles&nbsp;</p>
<p>and burns them in the incinerator. That's the smoke."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Whoa."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's what I used to say to myself whenever I was in class and&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw the smoke outside the window. "Whoa'. Think about it: the school&nbsp;</p>
<p>had almost a thousand girls. So, say 900 of them have started their&nbsp;</p>
<p>periods, and maybe a fifth of them are menstruating at any one time:&nbsp;</p>
<p>180 girls. That's 180 girls' worth of towels in the receptacles every&nbsp;</p>
<p>day."&nbsp;</p>
<p>72&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I bet you're right - though I'm not sure about the maths."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, it's a lot. 180 girls. What do you think it feels like to collect&nbsp;</p>
<p>and burn that much stuff?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Can't imagine," I said. How could I have imagined what the old man&nbsp;</p>
<p>was going through? Midori and I went on watching the smoke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really didn't want to go to this school," Midori said. She gave her&nbsp;</p>
<p>head a little shake. "I wanted to go to an absolutely ordinary State&nbsp;</p>
<p>school with ordinary people where I could relax and have fun like an&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordinary teenager. But my parents thought it would look good for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go to this fancy place. They're the ones who stuck me in here. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>know: that's what happens when you do well in primary school. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>teacher tells your parents "With marks like hers, she ought to go&nbsp;</p>
<p>there.' So that's where I ended up. I went for six years and I never&nbsp;</p>
<p>liked it. All I could think about was getting out. And you know, I've&nbsp;</p>
<p>got certificates of merit for never having been late or missed a day of&nbsp;</p>
<p>school. That's how much I hated the place. Get it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I don't get it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's because I hated the place so much. I wasn't going to let it beat me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I'd let it get to me once I'd be finished. I was scared I'd just keep&nbsp;</p>
<p>slipping down and down. I'd crawl to school with a temperature of&nbsp;</p>
<p>103. The teacher would ask me if I was sick, but I'd say no. When I&nbsp;</p>
<p>left they gave me certificates for perfect attendance and punctuality,&nbsp;</p>
<p>plus a French dictionary. That's why I'm taking German now. I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to owe this school anything. I'm not kidding."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why did you hate it so much?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Did you like your school?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, no, but I didn't especially hate it, either. I went to an ordinary&nbsp;</p>
<p>State school but I never thought about it one way or another."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, this school," Midori said, scratching the corner of her eye with&nbsp;</p>
<p>her little finger, "had nothing but upper-class girls - almost a thousand&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls with good backgrounds and good exam results. Rich girls. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to be rich to survive. High tuition, endless contributions,&nbsp;</p>
<p>73&nbsp;</p>
<p>expensive school trips. For instance, if we went to Kyoto, they'd put&nbsp;</p>
<p>us up in a first-class inn and serve us tea ceremony food on lacquer&nbsp;</p>
<p>tables, and they'd take us once a year to the most expensive hotel in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo to study table manners. I mean, this was no ordinary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of 160 girls in my class, I was the only one from a middle-class&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbourhood like Toshima. I looked at the school register once to&nbsp;</p>
<p>see where the others lived, and every single one of them was from a&nbsp;</p>
<p>rich area. Well, no, there was one girl from way out in Chiba with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>farmers, so I got kind of friendly with her. And she was really nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She invited me to her house, though she apologized for how far I'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to travel to get there. I went and it was incredible, this giant&nbsp;</p>
<p>piece of land you'd have to walk 15 minutes to get around. It had this&nbsp;</p>
<p>amazing garden and two dogs like compact cars they fed steaks to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But still, this girl felt embarrassed about living out in Chiba. This is a&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl who would be driven to school in a Mercedes Benz if she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>late! By a chauffeur! Like right out of the Green Hornet: the hat, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>white gloves, the whole deal. And still she had this inferiority&nbsp;</p>
<p>complex. Can you believe it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was the only one in the whole school who lived in a place like Kita</p>
<p>Otsuka Toshima. And under "parent's profession' it said "bookshop&nbsp;</p>
<p>owner'. Everybody in my class thought that was so neat: "Oh, you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>so lucky, you can read any book you like' and stuff. Of course, they&nbsp;</p>
<p>were thinking of some monster bookshop like Kinokuniya. They could&nbsp;</p>
<p>never have imagined the poor, little Kobayashi Bookshop. The door&nbsp;</p>
<p>creaks open and you see nothing but magazines. The steady sellers are&nbsp;</p>
<p>the women's glossies with illustrated pull-out sections on the latest&nbsp;</p>
<p>sexual techniques. The local housewives buy them and sit at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>kitchen table reading them from cover to cover, and give 'em a try&nbsp;</p>
<p>when their husbands get home. And they've got the most incredible&nbsp;</p>
<p>positions! Is this what housewives have on their minds all day? The&nbsp;</p>
<p>comics are the other big-seller: Magazine, Sunday, Jump. And of&nbsp;</p>
<p>74&nbsp;</p>
<p>course the weeklies. So this "bookshop' is almost all magazines. Oh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are a few books, paperbacks, mysteries and swashbucklers and&nbsp;</p>
<p>romances. That's all that sells. And How-To books: how to win at Go,&nbsp;</p>
<p>how to raise bonsai, how to give wedding speeches, how to have sex,&nbsp;</p>
<p>how to stop smoking, you name it. We even sell writing supplies -&nbsp;</p>
<p>stacks of ballpoint pens and pencils and notebooks next to the till. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>that's it. No War and Peace, no Kenzaburo Oe, no Catcher in the Rye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the Kobayashi Bookshop. That's how "lucky' I am. Do you&nbsp;</p>
<p>think I'm lucky?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can just see the place."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know what I mean. Everybody in the neighbourhood comes&nbsp;</p>
<p>there, some of them for years, and we deliver. It's a good business,&nbsp;</p>
<p>more than enough to support a family of four; no debts, two daughters&nbsp;</p>
<p>in college, but that's it. Nothing to spare for extras. They should never&nbsp;</p>
<p>have sent me to a school like that. It was a recipe for heartache. I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>to listen to them grumble to me every time the school asked for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>contribution, and I was always scared to death I'd run out of money if&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went out with my school friends and they wanted to eat somewhere&nbsp;</p>
<p>expensive. It's a miserable way to live. Is your family rich?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My family? No, my parents are absolutely ordinary working people,&nbsp;</p>
<p>not rich, not poor. I know it's not easy for them to send me to a private&nbsp;</p>
<p>university in Tokyo, but there's just me, so it's not that big a deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They don't give me much to live on, so I work part-time. We live in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>typical house with a little garden and our car is a Toyota Corolla."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's your job like?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I work in a Shinjuku record shop three nights a week. It's easy. I just&nbsp;</p>
<p>sit there and mind the shop."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're joking?" said Midori. "I don't know, just looking at you I sort&nbsp;</p>
<p>of assumed you'd never been hard up."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true. I have never been hard up. Not that I have tons of money,&nbsp;</p>
<p>either. I'm like most people."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, "most people' in my school were rich," said Midori, palms&nbsp;</p>
<p>75&nbsp;</p>
<p>resting on her lap. "That was the problem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So now you'll have plenty of chances to see a world without that&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem. More than you want to, maybe."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, tell me, what do you think the best thing is about being rich?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Being able to say you don't have any money. Like, if I suggested to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>school friend we do something, she could say, 'Sorry, I don't have any&nbsp;</p>
<p>money'. Which is something I could never say if the situation was&nbsp;</p>
<p>reversed. If I said "I don't have any money', it would really mean "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't have any money'. It's sad. Like, if a pretty girl says "I look&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible today, I don't want to go out,' that's OK, but if an ugly girl says&nbsp;</p>
<p>the same thing people laugh at her. That's what the world was like for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. For six years, until last year."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You'll get over it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hope so. University is such a relief! It's full of ordinary people."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She smiled with the slightest curl of her lip and smoothed her short&nbsp;</p>
<p>hair with the palm of her hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you have a job?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I write map notes. You know those little pamphlets that come&nbsp;</p>
<p>with maps? With descriptions of the different neighbourhoods and&nbsp;</p>
<p>population figures and points of interest. Here there's so-and-so hiking&nbsp;</p>
<p>trail or such-and-such a legend, or some special flower or bird. I write&nbsp;</p>
<p>the texts for those things. It's so easy! Takes no time at all. I can write&nbsp;</p>
<p>a whole booklet with a day of looking things up in the library. All you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to do is master a couple of secrets and all kinds of work comes&nbsp;</p>
<p>your way."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What kind of secrets?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like you put in some little something that nobody else has written&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the people at the map company think you're a literary genius and&nbsp;</p>
<p>send you more work. It doesn't have to be anything at all, just some&nbsp;</p>
<p>tiny thing. Like, say, when they built a dam in this particular valley,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the water covered over a village, but still every spring the birds come&nbsp;</p>
<p>76&nbsp;</p>
<p>up from the south and you can see them flying over the lake. Put in&nbsp;</p>
<p>one little episode like that and people love it, it's so graphic and&nbsp;</p>
<p>sentimental. The usual part-timer doesn't bother with stuff like that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I can make decent money with what I write."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you have to find those "episodes'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"True," said Midori with a tilt of her head. "But if you're looking for&nbsp;</p>
<p>them, you usually find them. And if you don't, you can always make&nbsp;</p>
<p>up something harmless."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Aha!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace," said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said she wanted to hear about my dormitory, so I told her the&nbsp;</p>
<p>usual stories about the raising of the flag and Storm Trooper's radio&nbsp;</p>
<p>callisthenics. Storm Trooper especially made Midori laugh, as he&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to do with everyone. She said she thought it would be fun to&nbsp;</p>
<p>have a look at the dorm. There was nothing fun about the place, I told&nbsp;</p>
<p>her: "Just a few hundred guys in grubby rooms, drinking and&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanking."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does that include you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It includes every man on the face of the earth," I explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Girls have periods and boys wank. Everybody."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Even ones with girlfriends? I mean, sex partners."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's got nothing to do with that. The Keio student living next door to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me has a wank before every date. He says it relaxes him."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know much about that stuff. I was in a girls' school so long."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess the glossy women's magazines don't go into that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all!" she said, laughing. "Anyway, Watanabe, would you have&nbsp;</p>
<p>some time this Sunday? Are you free?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm free every Sunday. Until six, at least. That's when I go to work."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why don't you visit me? At the Kobayashi Bookshop. The shop itself&nbsp;</p>
<p>will be closed, but I have to hang around there alone all day. I might&nbsp;</p>
<p>be getting an important phone call. How about lunch? I'll cook for&nbsp;</p>
<p>77&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like that," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori tore a page from a notebook and drew a detailed map of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>way to her place. She used a red pen to make a large X where the&nbsp;</p>
<p>house stood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't miss it. There's a big sign: 'Kobayashi Bookshop'. Come at&nbsp;</p>
<p>noon. I'll have lunch ready."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thanked her and put the map in my pocket. "I'd better get back to&nbsp;</p>
<p>campus now," I said. "My German lecture starts at two." Midori said&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had somewhere to go and took the train from Yotsuya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunday morning I got up at nine, shaved, did my laundry and hung out&nbsp;</p>
<p>the clothes on the roof. It was a beautiful day. The first smell of&nbsp;</p>
<p>autumn was in the air. Red dragonflies flitted around the quadrangle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>chased by neighbourhood kids swinging nets. With no wind, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rising Sun flag hung limp on its pole. I put on a freshly ironed shirt&nbsp;</p>
<p>and walked from the dorm to the tram stop. A student neighbourhood&nbsp;</p>
<p>on a Sunday morning: the streets were dead, virtually empty, most&nbsp;</p>
<p>shops closed. What few sounds there were echoed with special clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A girl wearing sabots clip-clopped across the asphalt roadway, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>next to the tram shelter four or five kids were throwing rocks at a row&nbsp;</p>
<p>of empty cans. A florist's was open, so I went in and bought some&nbsp;</p>
<p>daffodils. Daffodils in autumn: that was strange. But I had always&nbsp;</p>
<p>liked that particular flower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three old women were the only passengers on the Sunday morning&nbsp;</p>
<p>tram. They all looked at me and my flowers. One of them gave me a&nbsp;</p>
<p>smile. I smiled back. I sat in the last seat and watched the ancient&nbsp;</p>
<p>houses passing close to the window. The tram almost touched the&nbsp;</p>
<p>overhanging eaves. The laundry deck of one house had ten potted&nbsp;</p>
<p>tomato plants, next to which a big black cat lay stretched out in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sun. In the garden of another house, a little girl was blowing soap&nbsp;</p>
<p>bubbles. I heard an Ayumi Ishida song coming from somewhere, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>78&nbsp;</p>
<p>could even catch the smell of curry cooking. The tram snaked its way&nbsp;</p>
<p>through this private back-alley world. A few more passengers got on&nbsp;</p>
<p>at stops along the way, but the three old women went on talking&nbsp;</p>
<p>intently about something, huddled together face-to-face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got off near Otsuka Station and followed Midori's map down a broad&nbsp;</p>
<p>street without much to look at. None of the shops along the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to be doing very well, housed as they were in old buildings&nbsp;</p>
<p>with gloomy-looking interiors and faded writing on some of the signs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging from the age and style of the buildings, this area had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>spared the wartime air raids, leaving whole blocks intact. A few of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>places had been entirely rebuilt, but just about all had been enlarged or&nbsp;</p>
<p>repaired in places, and it was these additions that tended to look&nbsp;</p>
<p>shabbier than the old buildings themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole atmosphere of the place suggested that most of the original&nbsp;</p>
<p>residents had become fed up with the cars, the filthy air, the noise and&nbsp;</p>
<p>high rents and moved to the suburbs, leaving only cheap flats and&nbsp;</p>
<p>company apartments&nbsp;</p>
<p>and hard-to-sell shops and a few stubborn people who clung to old&nbsp;</p>
<p>family properties. Everything looked blurred and grimy as though&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrapped in a haze of exhaust fumes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ten minutes' walk down this street brought me to a corner petrol&nbsp;</p>
<p>station, where I turned right into a small block of shops, in the middle&nbsp;</p>
<p>of which hung the sign for the Kobayashi Bookshop. True, it was not&nbsp;</p>
<p>a big shop, but neither was it as small as Midori's description had led&nbsp;</p>
<p>me to believe. It was just a typical neighbourhood bookshop, the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind I used to run to on the very day the boys' comics came out. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>nostalgic mood overtook me as I stood in front of the place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole front of the shop was sealed off by a big, rolldown metal&nbsp;</p>
<p>shutter inscribed with a magazine advertisement:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"WEEKLY BUNSHUN SOLD HERE THURSDAYS". I still had 15&nbsp;</p>
<p>minutes before noon, but I didn't want to kill time wandering through&nbsp;</p>
<p>the block with a handful of daffodils, so I pressed the doorbell beside&nbsp;</p>
<p>79&nbsp;</p>
<p>the shutter and stepped a few paces back to wait. Fifteen seconds went&nbsp;</p>
<p>by without an answer, and I was debating with myself whether to ring&nbsp;</p>
<p>again when I heard a window clatter open above me. I looked up to&nbsp;</p>
<p>see Midori leaning out and waving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come in," she yelled. "Lift the shutter."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is it OK? I'm kind of early," I shouted back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No problem. Come upstairs. I'm busy in the kitchen." She pulled the&nbsp;</p>
<p>window closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shutter made a terrific grinding noise as I raised it three feet from&nbsp;</p>
<p>the ground, ducked under, and lowered it again. The shop was pitch&nbsp;</p>
<p>black inside. I managed to feel my way to the back stairway, tripping&nbsp;</p>
<p>over bound piles of magazines. I unlaced my shoes and climbed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>stairs to the living area. The interior of the house was dark and&nbsp;</p>
<p>gloomy. The stairs led to a simple parlour with a sofa and easy chairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a small room with dim light coming in the window, reminiscent&nbsp;</p>
<p>of old Polish films. There was a kind of storage area on the left and&nbsp;</p>
<p>what looked like the door to a bathroom. I had to climb the steep&nbsp;</p>
<p>stairway with care to reach the second floor, but once I got there, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was so much brighter than the first that I felt greatly relieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Over here," called Midori's voice. To the right at the top of the stairs&nbsp;</p>
<p>was what looked like a dining room, and beyond that a kitchen. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>house itself was old, but the kitchen seemed to have been refitted&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently with new cabinets and a bright, shiny sink and taps. Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>was preparing food. A pot was bubbling, and the air was filled with&nbsp;</p>
<p>the smell of grilled fish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's beer in the fridge," she said with a glance in my direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Have a seat while I finish this." I took a can and sat at the kitchen&nbsp;</p>
<p>table. The beer was so cold it might have been in the fridge for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>best part of a year. On the table lay a small, white ashtray, a&nbsp;</p>
<p>newspaper, and a soy sauce dispenser. There was also a notepad and&nbsp;</p>
<p>pen, with a phone number and some figures on the pad that seemed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>be calculations connected with shopping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>80&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I should have this done in ten minutes," she said. "Can you stand the&nbsp;</p>
<p>wait?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I can," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Get good and hungry, then. I'm making a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sipped my beer and focused on Midori as she went on cooking, her&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to me. She worked with quick, nimble movements, handling no&nbsp;</p>
<p>fewer than four cooking procedures at once. Over here she tasted a&nbsp;</p>
<p>boiled dish, and the next second she was at the cutting board, rat-tat</p>
<p>tatting, then she took something out of the fridge and piled it in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>bowl, and before I knew it she had washed a pot she had finished&nbsp;</p>
<p>using. From the back she looked like an Indian percussionist - ringing&nbsp;</p>
<p>a bell, tapping a block, striking a water-buffalo bone, each movement&nbsp;</p>
<p>precise and economical, with perfect balance. I watched in awe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let me know if there's something I can do," I said, just in case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK," said Midori with a smile in my direction. "I'm used to&nbsp;</p>
<p>doing everything alone." She wore slim blue jeans and a navy T-shirt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Apple Records logo nearly covered the back of the shirt. She had&nbsp;</p>
<p>extremely narrow hips, as if she had somehow skipped puberty when&nbsp;</p>
<p>the hips grow fuller, and this gave her a far more androgynous look&nbsp;</p>
<p>than most girls have in slim jeans. The light pouring in from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>kitchen window gave her figure a kind of vague outline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You really didn't have to put together such a feast," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's no feast," answered Midori without turning my way. "I was too&nbsp;</p>
<p>busy to do any real shopping yesterday. I'm just throwing together a&nbsp;</p>
<p>few things I had in the fridge. Really, don't worry. Besides, it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kobayashi family tradition to treat guests well. I don't know what it is,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but we like to entertain. It's inborn; a kind of sickness. Not that we're&nbsp;</p>
<p>especially nice or people love us or anything, but if somebody shows&nbsp;</p>
<p>up we have to treat them well no matter what. We've all got the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>personality flaw, for better or worse. Take my father, for example. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>hardly drinks, but the house is full of alcohol. What for? To serve&nbsp;</p>
<p>guests! So don't hold back: drink all the beer you want."&nbsp;</p>
<p>81&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It suddenly dawned on me that I had left the daffodils downstairs. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had set them aside while unlacing my shoes. I slipped back downstairs&nbsp;</p>
<p>and found the ten bright blossoms lying in the gloom. Midori took a&nbsp;</p>
<p>tall, slim glass from the cupboard and arranged the flowers in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I love daffodils," said Midori. "I once sang "Seven Daffodils' in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>school talent contest. Do you know it?" "Of course."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We had a folk group. I played guitar."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She sang "Seven Daffodils' as she arranged the food on plates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's cooking was far better than I had expected: an amazing&nbsp;</p>
<p>assortment of fried, pickled, boiled and roasted dishes using eggs,&nbsp;</p>
<p>mackerel, fresh greens, aubergine, mushrooms, radishes, and sesame&nbsp;</p>
<p>seeds, all cooked in the delicate Kyoto style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is great," I said with my mouth full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, tell me the truth now," Midori said. "You weren't expecting my&nbsp;</p>
<p>cooking to be very good, were you - judging from the way I look?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not really," I said honestly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're from the Kansai region, so you like this kind of delicate&nbsp;</p>
<p>flavouring, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't tell me you changed style especially for me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous! I wouldn't go to that much trouble. No, we&nbsp;</p>
<p>always eat like this."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So your mother - or your father - is from Kansai?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nope. My father was born in Tokyo and my mother's from&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fukushima. There's not a single Kansai person among my relatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're all from Tokyo or northern Kanto."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't get it," I said. "How can you make this 100 per cent authentic&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kansai-style food? Did somebody teach you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, it's kind of a long story," she said, eating a slice of fried egg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My mother hated housework of any kind, and she almost never&nbsp;</p>
<p>82&nbsp;</p>
<p>cooked anything. And we had the business to think about, so it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>always "Today we're so busy, let's get a take-away' or "Let's just buy&nbsp;</p>
<p>some croquettes at the butcher's' and so on. I hated that even when I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was little, I mean like cooking a big pot of curry and eating the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing three days in a row. So then one day - I was in the fifth year of&nbsp;</p>
<p>school - I decided I was going to cook for the family and do it right. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>went to the big Kinokuniya in Shinjuku and bought the biggest,&nbsp;</p>
<p>handsomest cookbook I could find, and I mastered it from cover to&nbsp;</p>
<p>cover: how to choose a cutting board, how to sharpen knives, how to&nbsp;</p>
<p>bone a fish, how to shave fresh bonito flakes, everything. It turned out&nbsp;</p>
<p>the author of the book was from the Kansai, so all my cooking is&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kansai style."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean you learned how to make all this stuff from a book?!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I saved my money and went to eat the real thing. That's how I learned&nbsp;</p>
<p>flavourings. I've got pretty good intuition. I'm hopeless as a logical&nbsp;</p>
<p>thinker, though."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's amazing you could teach yourself to cook so well without having&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyone to show you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It wasn't easy," said Midori with a sigh, "growing up in a house&nbsp;</p>
<p>where nobody gave a damn about food. I'd tell them I wanted to buy&nbsp;</p>
<p>decent knives and pots and they wouldn't give me the money. "What&nbsp;</p>
<p>we have now is good enough,' they'd say, but I'd tell them that was&nbsp;</p>
<p>crazy, you couldn't bone a fish with the kind of flimsy knives we had&nbsp;</p>
<p>at home, so they'd say, "What the hell do you have to bone a fish for?'&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was hopeless trying to communicate with them. I saved up my&nbsp;</p>
<p>allowance and bought real professional knives and pots and strainers&nbsp;</p>
<p>and stuff. Can you believe it? Here's a 15-year-old girl pinching&nbsp;</p>
<p>pennies to buy strainers and whetstones and tempura pots when all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>other girls at school are getting huge allowances and buying beautiful&nbsp;</p>
<p>dresses and shoes. Don't you feel sorry&nbsp;</p>
<p>for me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>83&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded, swallowing a mouthful of clear soup with fresh junsai&nbsp;</p>
<p>greens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I was in the sixth-form, I had to have an egg fryer - a long,&nbsp;</p>
<p>narrow pan for making this dashimaki-style fried egg we're eating. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>bought it with money I was supposed to use for a new bra. For three&nbsp;</p>
<p>months I had to live with one bra. Can you believe it? I'd wash my bra&nbsp;</p>
<p>at night, go crazy trying to dry it, and wear it the next day. And if it&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't dry right, I had a tragedy to deal with. The saddest thing in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>world is wearing a damp bra. I'd walk around with tears pouring from&nbsp;</p>
<p>my eyes. To think I was suffering this for an egg fryer!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I see what you mean," I said with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know I shouldn't say this, but actually it was kind of a relief to me&nbsp;</p>
<p>when my mother died. I could run the family budget my way. I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>buy what I liked. So now I've got a relatively complete set of cooking&nbsp;</p>
<p>utensils. My father doesn't know a thing about the budget."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When did your mother die?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Two years ago. Cancer. Brain tumour. She was in the hospital a year&nbsp;</p>
<p>and a half. It was terrible. She suffered from beginning to end. Finally&nbsp;</p>
<p>lost her mind; had to be doped up all the time, and still she couldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>die, though when she did it was practically a mercy killing. It's the&nbsp;</p>
<p>worst kind of death - the person's in agony, the family goes through&nbsp;</p>
<p>hell. It took every yen we had. I mean, they'd give her these shots -&nbsp;</p>
<p>bang, bang, x"20,000 a pop, and she had to have round-the-clock care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was so busy with her, I couldn't study, had to delay university for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>year. And as if that weren't bad enough - " She stopped in mid</p>
<p>sentence, put her chopsticks down and sighed. "How did this&nbsp;</p>
<p>conversation turn so dark all of a sudden?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It started with the business about the bras," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So anyway, eat your eggs and think about what I just told you,”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori said with a solemn expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eating my portion filled me up, but Midori ate far less. "Cooking ruins&nbsp;</p>
<p>my appetite," she said. She cleared the table, wiped up the crumbs,&nbsp;</p>
<p>84&nbsp;</p>
<p>brought out a box of Marlboro, put one in her mouth and lit up with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>match. Taking hold of the glass with the daffodils, she studied the&nbsp;</p>
<p>blooms for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't think I'll put them in a vase," she said. "If I leave them like&nbsp;</p>
<p>this, it's like I just happened to pick them by a pond somewhere and&nbsp;</p>
<p>threw them into the first thing that came to hand."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I did pick them by the pond at Otsuka Station," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She chuckled. "You are a weird one. Making jokes with a perfectly&nbsp;</p>
<p>straight face."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chin in hand, she smoked half her cigarette, then crushed it out in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ashtray. She rubbed her eyes as if smoke had got into them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Girls are supposed to be a little more elegant when they put out their&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarettes. You did that like a lumberjack. You shouldn't just cram it&nbsp;</p>
<p>down in the ashtray but press it lightly around the edges of the ash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it doesn't get all bent up. And girls are never supposed to blow&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoke through their noses. And most girls wouldn't talk about how&nbsp;</p>
<p>they wore the same bra for three months when they're eating alone&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a man."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I am a lumberjack," Midori said, scratching next to her nose. "I can&nbsp;</p>
<p>never manage to be chic. I try it as a joke sometimes, but it never&nbsp;</p>
<p>sticks. Any more critiques for me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Girls don't smoke Marlboro," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's the difference? One tastes as bad as another." She turned the&nbsp;</p>
<p>red Marlboro packet over and over in her hand. "I started smoking last&nbsp;</p>
<p>month. It's not as if I was dying for tobacco or anything. I just sort of&nbsp;</p>
<p>felt like it." "Why's that?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She pressed her hands together on the table and thought about it for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>while. "What's the difference? You don't smoke?" "Stopped in June," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How come?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It was a pain. I hated running out of smokes in the middle of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>night. I don't like having something control me that way."&nbsp;</p>
<p>85&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're very clear about what you like and what you don't like," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe so," I said. "Maybe that's why people don't like me. Never&nbsp;</p>
<p>have."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's because you show it," she said. "You make it obvious you don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She spoke in a near mumble, chin in hand. "But I like talking to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way you talk is so unusual. "I don't like having something control&nbsp;</p>
<p>me that way'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I helped her wash the dishes. Standing next to her, I wiped as she&nbsp;</p>
<p>washed, and stacked everything on the worktop. "So," I said, "your&nbsp;</p>
<p>family's out today?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My mother's in her grave. She died two years ago." "Yeah, I heard&nbsp;</p>
<p>that part."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My sister's on a date with her fiancé. Probably on a drive. Her&nbsp;</p>
<p>boyfriend works for some car company. He loves cars. I don't love&nbsp;</p>
<p>cars."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori stopped talking and washed. I stopped talking and wiped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And then there's my father," she said after some time had gone by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He went off to Uruguay in June last year and he's been there ever&nbsp;</p>
<p>since."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uruguay?! Why Uruguay?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He was thinking of settling there, believe it or not. An old army&nbsp;</p>
<p>buddy of his has a farm there. All of a sudden, my father announces&nbsp;</p>
<p>he's going, too, that there's no limit to what he can do in Uruguay, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>he gets on a plane and that's that. We tried hard to stop him, like,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why do you want to go to a place like that? You can't speak the&nbsp;</p>
<p>language, you've hardly ever left Tokyo.' But he wouldn't listen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Losing my mother was a real shock to him. I mean, it made him a&nbsp;</p>
<p>86&nbsp;</p>
<p>little cuckoo. That's how much he loved her. Really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was not much I could say in reply. I stared at Midori with my&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you think he said to my sister and me when our mother&nbsp;</p>
<p>died? "I would much rather have lost the two of you than her.' It&nbsp;</p>
<p>knocked the wind out of me. I couldn't say a word. You know what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>mean? You just can't say something like that. OK, he lost the woman&nbsp;</p>
<p>he loved, his partner for life. I understand the pain, the sadness, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>heartbreak. I pity him. But you don't tell the daughters you fathered&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You should have died in her place'. I mean, that's just too terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't you agree?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I see your point."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's one wound that will never go away," she said, shaking her&nbsp;</p>
<p>head. "But anyway, everyone in my family's a little different. We've&nbsp;</p>
<p>all got something just a little bit strange."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So it seems," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Still, it is wonderful for two people to love each other, don't you&nbsp;</p>
<p>think? I mean, for a man to love his wife so much he can tell his&nbsp;</p>
<p>daughters they should have died in her place&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe so, now that you put it that way."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And then he dumps the two of us and runs off to Uruguay."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wiped another dish without replying. After the last one, Midori put&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything back in the cabinets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, have you heard from your father?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"One postcard. In March. But what does he write? "It's hot here' or&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The fruit's not as good as I expected'. Stuff like that. I mean, give me&nbsp;</p>
<p>a break! One stupid picture of a donkey! He's lost his marbles! He&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't even say whether he'd met that guy - that friend of his or&nbsp;</p>
<p>whatever. He did add near the end that once he's settled he'll send for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me and my sister, but not a word since then. And he never answers our&nbsp;</p>
<p>letters."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What would you do if your father said "Come to Uruguay'?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>87&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd go and have a look around at least. It might be fun. My sister says&nbsp;</p>
<p>she'd absolutely refuse. She can't stand dirty things and dirty places."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is Uruguay dirty?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Who knows? She thinks it is. Like the roads are full of donkey shit&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it's swarming with flies, and the toilets don't work, and lizards and&nbsp;</p>
<p>scorpions crawl all over the place. She maybe saw a film like that. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>can't stand flies, either. All she wants to do is drive through scenic&nbsp;</p>
<p>places in fancy cars."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I mean, what's wrong with Uruguay? I'd go." "So who's running the&nbsp;</p>
<p>shop?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My sister, but she hates it. We have an uncle in the neighbourhood&nbsp;</p>
<p>who helps out and makes deliveries. And I help when I have time. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>bookshop's not exactly hard labour, so we can manage. If it gets to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>too much, we'll sell the place."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you like your father?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori shook her head. "Not especially." "So how can you follow him&nbsp;</p>
<p>to Uruguay?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I believe in him."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Believe in him?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"yeah, I'm not that fond of him, but I believe in my father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I not believe in a man who gives up his house, his kids, his&nbsp;</p>
<p>work, and runs off to Uruguay from the shock of losing his wife? Do&nbsp;</p>
<p>you see what I mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sighed. "Sort of, but not really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori laughed and patted me on the back. "Never mind," she said. "It&nbsp;</p>
<p>really doesn't matter."&nbsp;</p>
<p>One weird thing after another came up that Sunday afternoon. A fire&nbsp;</p>
<p>broke out near Midori's house and, when we went up to the third-floor&nbsp;</p>
<p>laundry deck to watch, we sort of kissed. It sounds stupid when I put it&nbsp;</p>
<p>like that, but that was how things worked out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were drinking coffee after the meal and talking about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>88&nbsp;</p>
<p>university when we heard sirens. They got louder and louder and&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to be increasing in number. Lots of people ran past the shop,&nbsp;</p>
<p>some of them shouting. Midori went to a room facing the street,&nbsp;</p>
<p>opened the window and looked down. "Wait here a minute," she said&nbsp;</p>
<p>and disappeared; after which I heard feet pounding up stairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat there drinking coffee alone and trying to remember where&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uruguay was. Let's see, Brazil was over here, and Venezuela there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Colombia somewhere over here, but I couldn't recall the location&nbsp;</p>
<p>of Uruguay. A few minutes later Midori came down and urged me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>hurry somewhere with her. I followed her to the end of the hall and&nbsp;</p>
<p>climbed a steep, narrow stairway to a wooden deck with bamboo&nbsp;</p>
<p>laundry poles. The deck was higher than most of the surrounding&nbsp;</p>
<p>rooftops and gave a good view of the neighbourhood. Huge clouds of&nbsp;</p>
<p>black smoke shot up from a place three or four houses away and&nbsp;</p>
<p>flowed with the breeze out towards the high street. A burning smell&nbsp;</p>
<p>filled the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's Sakamoto's place," said Midori, leaning over the railing. "They&nbsp;</p>
<p>used to make traditional door fittings and stuff. They went out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>business some time ago, though."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leaned over the railing with her and strained to see what was going&nbsp;</p>
<p>on. A three-storey building blocked our view of the fire, but there&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to be three or four fire engines over there working on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>blaze. No more than two of them could squeeze into the narrow lane&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the house was burning, the rest standing by on the high street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usual crowd of gawkers filled the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, maybe you should gather your valuables together and get ready&nbsp;</p>
<p>to evacuate this place," I said to Midori. "The wind's blowing the other&nbsp;</p>
<p>way now, but it could change any time, and you've got a petrol station&nbsp;</p>
<p>right there. I'll help you pack."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What valuables?" said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, you must have something you'd want to save - bankbooks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>seals, legal papers, stuff like that. Emergency cash." "Forget it. I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>89&nbsp;</p>
<p>running away."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Even if this place burns?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You heard me. I don't mind dying."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked her in the eye, and she looked straight at me. I couldn't tell if&nbsp;</p>
<p>she was serious or joking. We stayed like that for a while, and soon I&nbsp;</p>
<p>stopped worrying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK," I said. "I get it. I'll stay with you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You'll die with me?" Midori asked with shining eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said. "I'll run if it gets dangerous. If you want to die, you&nbsp;</p>
<p>can do it alone."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Cold-hearted bastard!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not going to die with you just because you made lunch for me. Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, if it had been dinner. .."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, well ... Anyway, let's stay here and watch for a while. We can&nbsp;</p>
<p>sing songs. And if something bad happens, we can think about it&nbsp;</p>
<p>then."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sing songs?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori brought two floor pillows, four cans of beer and a guitar from&nbsp;</p>
<p>downstairs. We drank and watched the black smoke rising. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>strummed and sang. I asked her if she didn't think this might anger the&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbours. Drinking beer and singing while you watched a local fire&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the laundry deck didn't seem like the most admirable behaviour I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could think of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Forget it," she said. "We never worry about what the neighbours&nbsp;</p>
<p>might think."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She sang some of the folk songs she had played with her group. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would have been hard pressed to say she was good, but she did seem&nbsp;</p>
<p>to enjoy her own music. She went through all the old standards -&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lemon Tree", "Puff (The Magic Dragon)", "Five Hundred Miles",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?", "Michael, Row the Boat&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ashore". At first she tried to get me to sing bass harmony, but I was so&nbsp;</p>
<p>bad she gave up and sang alone to her heart's content. I worked on my&nbsp;</p>
<p>90&nbsp;</p>
<p>beer and listened to her sing and kept an eye on the fire. It flared up&nbsp;</p>
<p>and died down several times. People were yelling and giving orders. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>newspaper helicopter clattered overhead, took photographs and flew&nbsp;</p>
<p>away. I worried that we might be in the picture. A policeman&nbsp;</p>
<p>screamed through a loudspeaker for bystanders to get back. A little kid&nbsp;</p>
<p>was crying for his mother. Glass shattered somewhere. Before long&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wind began shifting unpredictably, and white ash flakes fell out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the air around us, but Midori went on sipping and singing. After she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had gone through most of the songs she knew, she sang an odd one&nbsp;</p>
<p>that she said she had written herself:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to cook a stew for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have no pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to knit a scarf for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have no wool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to write a poem for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have no pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's called "I Have Nothing'," Midori announced. It was a truly&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible song, both words and music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I listened to this musical mess thinking that the house would blow&nbsp;</p>
<p>apart in the explosion if the petrol station caught fire. Tired of singing,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori put down her guitar and slumped against my shoulder like a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cat in the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How did you like my song?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I answered cautiously, "It was unique and original and very expressive&nbsp;</p>
<p>of your personality."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks," she said. "The theme is that I have nothing." "Yeah, I kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of thought so."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know," she said, "when my mother died. .." "Yeah?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I didn't feel the least bit sad."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I didn't feel sad when my father left, either." "Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>91&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true. Don't you think I'm terrible? Cold-hearted?" "I'm sure you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have your reasons."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My reasons. Hmm. Things were pretty complicated in this house. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always thought, I mean, they're my mother and father, of course I'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>be sad if they died or I never saw them again. But it didn't happen that&nbsp;</p>
<p>way. I didn't feel anything. Not sad, not lonely. I hardly even think of&nbsp;</p>
<p>them. Sometimes I'll have dreams, though. Sometimes my mother will&nbsp;</p>
<p>be glaring at me out of the darkness and she'll accuse me of being&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy she died. But I'm not happy she died. I'm just not very sad. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>to tell the truth, I never shed a single tear. I cried all night when my&nbsp;</p>
<p>cat died, though, when I was little."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why so much smoke? I wondered. I couldn't see flames, and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>burning area didn't seem to be spreading. There was just this column&nbsp;</p>
<p>of smoke winding up into the sky. What could have kept burning so&nbsp;</p>
<p>long?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I'm not the only one to blame," Midori continued. "It's true I have&nbsp;</p>
<p>a cold streak. I recognize that. But if they - my father and mother - had&nbsp;</p>
<p>loved me a little more, I would have been able to feel more - to feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>real sadness, for example."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you think you weren't loved enough?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>She tilted her head and looked at me. Then she gave a sharp, little nod.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Somewhere between "not enough' and "not at all'. I was always&nbsp;</p>
<p>hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get&nbsp;</p>
<p>my fill of it - to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. Just&nbsp;</p>
<p>once. But they never gave that to me. Never, not once. If I tried to&nbsp;</p>
<p>cuddle up and beg for something, they'd just shove me away and yell&nbsp;</p>
<p>at me. "No! That costs too much!' It's all I ever heard. So I made up&nbsp;</p>
<p>my mind I was going to find someone who would love me uncon</p>
<p>ditionally 365 days a year. I was still in primary school at the time, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made up my mind once and for all."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wow," I said. "And did your search pay off?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's the hard part," said Midori. She watched the rising smoke for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>92&nbsp;</p>
<p>while, thinking. "I guess I've been waiting so long I'm looking for&nbsp;</p>
<p>perfection. That makes it tough."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Waiting for the perfect love?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, even I know better than that. I'm looking for selfishness. Perfect&nbsp;</p>
<p>selfishness. Like, say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortbread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you stop everything you're doing and run out and buy it for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and&nbsp;</p>
<p>hold this strawberry shortbread out to me. And I say I don't want it&nbsp;</p>
<p>any more and throw it out of the window. That's what I'm looking&nbsp;</p>
<p>for."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that has anything to do with love," I said with some&nbsp;</p>
<p>amazement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It does," she said. "You just don't know it. There are times in a girl's&nbsp;</p>
<p>life when things like that are incredibly important."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Things like throwing strawberry shortbread out of the window?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Exactly. And when I do it, I want the man to apologize to me. "Now I&nbsp;</p>
<p>see, Midori. What a fool I've been! I should have known that you&nbsp;</p>
<p>would lose your desire for strawberry shortbread. I have all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>intelligence and sensitivity of a piece of donkey shit. To make it up to&nbsp;</p>
<p>you, I'll go out and buy you something else. What would you like?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chocolate mousse? Cheesecake?"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So then what?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So then I'd give him all the love he deserves for what he's done."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds crazy to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, to me, that's what love is. Not that anyone can understand me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>though." Midori gave her head a little shake against my shoulder. "For&nbsp;</p>
<p>a certain kind of person, love begins from something tiny or silly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From something like that or it doesn't begin at all."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've never met a girl who thinks like you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A lot of people tell me that," she said, digging at a cuticle. "But it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only way I know how to think. Seriously. I'm just telling you what&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe. It's never crossed my mind that my way of thinking is&nbsp;</p>
<p>93&nbsp;</p>
<p>different from other people's. I'm not trying to be different. But when I&nbsp;</p>
<p>speak out honestly, everybody thinks I'm kidding or play-acting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that happens, I feel like everything's such a pain!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you want to let yourself die in a fire?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, no, that's different. It's just a matter of curiosity."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What? Dying in a fire?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I just wanted to see how you'd react," Midori said. "But, I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>afraid of dying. Really. Like here, I'd just be overcome with smoke&nbsp;</p>
<p>and lose consciousness and die before I knew it. That doesn't frighten&nbsp;</p>
<p>me at all, compared to the way I saw my mother and a few relatives&nbsp;</p>
<p>die. All my relatives die after suffering from some terrible illness. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the blood, I guess. It's always a long, long process, and at the end&nbsp;</p>
<p>you almost can't tell whether the person is alive or dead. All that's left&nbsp;</p>
<p>is pain and suffering."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori put a Marlboro between her lips and lit it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's the kind of death that frightens me. The shadow of death&nbsp;</p>
<p>slowly, slowly eats away at the region of life, and before you know it&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything's dark and you can't see, and the people around you think&nbsp;</p>
<p>of you as more dead than alive. I hate that. I couldn't stand it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another half hour and the fire was out. They had apparently kept it&nbsp;</p>
<p>from spreading and prevented any injuries. All but one of the fire&nbsp;</p>
<p>engines returned to base, and the crowd dispersed, buzzing with&nbsp;</p>
<p>conversation. One police car remained to direct the traffic, its blue&nbsp;</p>
<p>light spinning. Two crows had settled on nearby lamp-posts to observe&nbsp;</p>
<p>the activity below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori seemed drained of energy. Limp, she stared at the sky and&nbsp;</p>
<p>barely spoke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tired?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not really," she said. "I just sort of let myself go limp and spaced out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First time in a long time."&nbsp;</p>
<p>94&nbsp;</p>
<p>She looked into my eyes, and I into hers. I put my arm around her and&nbsp;</p>
<p>kissed her. The slightest twinge went through her shoulders, and then&nbsp;</p>
<p>she relaxed and closed her eyes for several seconds. The early autumn&nbsp;</p>
<p>sun cast the shadow of her lashes on her cheek, and I could see it&nbsp;</p>
<p>trembling in outline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a soft and gentle kiss, one not meant to lead beyond itself. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would probably not have kissed Midori that day if we hadn't spent the&nbsp;</p>
<p>afternoon on the laundry deck in the sun, drinking beer and watching a&nbsp;</p>
<p>fire, and she no doubt felt the same. After a long time of watching the&nbsp;</p>
<p>glittering rooftops and the smoke and the red dragonflies and other&nbsp;</p>
<p>things, we had felt something warm and close, and we both probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted, half-consciously, to preserve that mood in some form. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>that kind of kiss. But as with all kisses, it was not without a certain&nbsp;</p>
<p>element of danger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first to speak was Midori. She held my hand and told me, with&nbsp;</p>
<p>what seemed like some difficulty, that she was seeing someone. I said&nbsp;</p>
<p>that I had sensed as much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you have a girl you like?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you're always free on Sundays, right?" "It's very complicated," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then I realized that the brief spell of the early autumn afternoon&nbsp;</p>
<p>had vanished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At five I said I had to go to work and suggested that Midori come with&nbsp;</p>
<p>me for a snack. She said she had to stay home in case the phone rang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hate waiting at home all day for a call. When I spend the day alone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel as if my flesh is rotting little by little - rotting and melting until&nbsp;</p>
<p>there's nothing left but a green puddle that gets sucked down into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>earth. And all that stays behind are my clothes. That's how it feels to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me, waiting indoors all day." "I'll keep you company next time you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to wait for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>95&nbsp;</p>
<p>call," I said. 'As long as lunch is included."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great," she said. "I'll arrange another fire for dessert."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori didn't come to the next day's History of Drama lecture. I went&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the cafeteria afterwards and ate a cold, tasteless lunch alone. Then I&nbsp;</p>
<p>sat in the sun and observed the campus scene. Two women students&nbsp;</p>
<p>next to me were carrying on a long conversation, standing the whole&nbsp;</p>
<p>time. One cradled a tennis racquet to her breast with all the loving care&nbsp;</p>
<p>she might give a baby, while the other held some books and a Leonard&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bernstein LP Both were pretty and obviously enjoying their&nbsp;</p>
<p>discussion. From the direction of the student club building came the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sound of a bass voice practising scales. Here and there stood groups of&nbsp;</p>
<p>four or five students expressing whatever opinions they happened to&nbsp;</p>
<p>hold, laughing and shouting to one another. There were skateboarders&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the car park. A professor with a leather briefcase in his arms&nbsp;</p>
<p>crossed the car park, avoiding them. In the quadrangle a helmeted girl&nbsp;</p>
<p>student knelt on the ground, painting huge characters on a sign with&nbsp;</p>
<p>something about American imperialism invading Asia. It was the&nbsp;</p>
<p>usual midday university scene, but as I sat watching it with renewed&nbsp;</p>
<p>attention, I became aware of something. In his or her own way,&nbsp;</p>
<p>everyone I saw before me looked happy. Whether they were really&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy or just looked it, I couldn't tell. But they did look happy on this&nbsp;</p>
<p>pleasant early afternoon in late September, and because of that I felt a&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind of loneliness new to me, as if I were the only one here who was&nbsp;</p>
<p>not truly part of the scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come to think of it, what scene had I been a part of in recent years?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last one I could remember was a pool hall near the harbour, where&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki and I played pool together in a spirit of total friendship. Kizuki&nbsp;</p>
<p>died that night, and ever since a cold, stiffening wind had come&nbsp;</p>
<p>between me and the world. This boy Kizuki: what had his existence&nbsp;</p>
<p>meant to me? To this question I could find no answer. All I knew -&nbsp;</p>
<p>with absolute certainty - was that Kizuki's death had robbed me for&nbsp;</p>
<p>96&nbsp;</p>
<p>ever of some part of my adolescence. But what that meant, and what&nbsp;</p>
<p>would come of it, were far beyond my understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat there for a long time, watching the campus and the people&nbsp;</p>
<p>passing through it, and hoping, too, that I might see Midori. But she&nbsp;</p>
<p>never appeared, and when the noon break ended, I went to the library&nbsp;</p>
<p>to prepare for my German class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa came to my room that Saturday afternoon and suggested we&nbsp;</p>
<p>have one of our nights on the town. He would arrange an overnight&nbsp;</p>
<p>pass for me. I said I would go. I had been feeling especially muddle</p>
<p>headed for the past week and was ready to sleep with anybody, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't matter who.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon I showered and shaved and put on fresh clothes -&nbsp;</p>
<p>a polo shirt and cotton jacket - then had dinner with Nagasawa in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dining hall and the two of us caught a bus to Shinjuku. We walked&nbsp;</p>
<p>around a lively area for a while, then went to one of our usual bars and&nbsp;</p>
<p>sat there waiting for a likely pair of girls. The girls tended to come in&nbsp;</p>
<p>pairs to this bar - except on this particular evening. We stayed there&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost two hours, sipping whisky and sodas at a rate that kept us&nbsp;</p>
<p>sober. Finally, two friendly-looking girls took seats at the bar,&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordering a gimlet and a margarita. Nagasawa approached them straight&nbsp;</p>
<p>away, but they said they were waiting for their boyfriends. Still, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>four of us enjoyed a pleasant chat until their dates showed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa took me to another bar to try our luck, a small&nbsp;</p>
<p>place in a kind of cul-de-sac, where most of the customers were&nbsp;</p>
<p>already drunk and noisy. A group of three girls occupied a table at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>back. We joined them and enjoyed a little conversation, the five of us&nbsp;</p>
<p>getting into a nice mood, but when Nagasawa suggested we go&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhere else for a drink, the girls said it was almost curfew time&nbsp;</p>
<p>and they had to go back to their dorms. So much for our "luck". We&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried one more place with the same result. For some reason, the girls&nbsp;</p>
<p>were just not coming our way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>97&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 11.30 Nagasawa was ready to give up. "Sorry I dragged you around&nbsp;</p>
<p>for nothing," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No problem," I said. "It was worth it to me just to see you have your&nbsp;</p>
<p>off days sometimes, too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe once a year," he admitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, I didn't care about getting laid any more. Wandering around&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shinjuku on a noisy Saturday night, observing the mysterious energy&nbsp;</p>
<p>created by a mixture of sex and alcohol, I began to feel that my own&nbsp;</p>
<p>desire was a puny thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now, Watanabe?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe go to an all-nighter," I said. "I haven't seen a film in ages."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll be going to Hatsumi's then," said Nagasawa. "Do you mind?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said. "Why should I mind?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you'd like, I could introduce you to a girl who'd let you spend the&nbsp;</p>
<p>night."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, I really am in the mood for a film."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry," said Nagasawa. "I'll make it up to you some time." And he&nbsp;</p>
<p>disappeared into the crowd. I went into a fast food place for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheeseburger and some coffee to kill the buzz, then went to see The&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graduate in an old rep house. I didn't think it was all that good, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't have anything better to do, so I stayed and watched it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emerging from the cinema at four in the morning, I wandered along&nbsp;</p>
<p>the chilly streets of Shinjuku, thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tired of walking, I went to an all-night café and waited with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>book and a cup of coffee for the morning trains to start. Before long,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the place became crowded with people who, like me, were waiting for&nbsp;</p>
<p>those first trains. A waiter came to ask me apologetically if I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>mind sharing my table. I said it would be all right. It didn't matter to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me who sat across from me: I was just reading a book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My companions at the table turned out to be two girls. They looked&nbsp;</p>
<p>about my age. Neither of them was a knockout, but they weren't bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both were reserved in the way they dressed and made up: they were&nbsp;</p>
<p>98&nbsp;</p>
<p>definitely not the type to be wandering around Shinjuku at five in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning. I guessed they had just happened to miss the last train. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed relieved to sit with me: I was neatly dressed, had shaved in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>evening, and to cap it all I was absorbed in Thomas Mann's The Magic&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the girls was on the large side. She wore a grey parka and&nbsp;</p>
<p>white jeans, carried a large vinyl pocketbook, and had large, shell</p>
<p>shaped earrings. Her friend was a small girl with glasses. She wore a&nbsp;</p>
<p>blue cardigan over a checked shirt and had a turquoise ring. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>smaller one had a habit of taking off her glasses and pressing her eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her fingertips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both girls ordered cafe au lait and cake, which it took them some time&nbsp;</p>
<p>to consume as they carried on what seemed like a serious discussion in&nbsp;</p>
<p>hushed tones. The large girl tilted her head several times, while the&nbsp;</p>
<p>small one shook hers just as often. I couldn't make out what they were&nbsp;</p>
<p>saying because of the loud stereo playing Marvin Gaye or the Bee&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gees or something, but it seemed the small girl was angry or upset and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the large girl was trying to comfort her. I alternated passages of my&nbsp;</p>
<p>book with glances in their direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clutching her shoulder bag to her breast, the smaller girl went to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ladies', at which point her companion spoke to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to bother you, but I wonder if you might know of ally bars&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood that would still be serving drinks?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taken off guard, I set my book aside and asked, "After five o'clock in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the morning?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes ... "If you ask me, at 5.20 in the morning, most people are on&nbsp;</p>
<p>their way home to get sober and go to bed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, I realize that," she said, a bit embarrassed, "but my friend says&nbsp;</p>
<p>she has to have a drink. It's kind of important."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's probably nothing much you can do but go home and have a&nbsp;</p>
<p>drink."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I have to catch a 7.30 train to Nagano."&nbsp;</p>
<p>99&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So find a vending machine and a nice place to sit. It's about all you&nbsp;</p>
<p>can do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know this is asking a lot, but could you come with us? Two girls&nbsp;</p>
<p>alone really can't do something like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had had a number of unusual experiences in Shinjuku, but I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>never before been invited to have a drink with two strange girls at 5.20&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the morning. Refusing would have been more trouble than it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>worth, and time was no problem, so I bought an armload of sake and&nbsp;</p>
<p>snacks from a nearby machine, and the three of us went to an empty&nbsp;</p>
<p>car park by the west exit of the station to hold an impromptu drinking&nbsp;</p>
<p>party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girls told me they had become friends working at a travel agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of them had graduated from college this year and started their&nbsp;</p>
<p>first jobs. The small one had a boyfriend she had been seeing for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>year, but had recently discovered he was sleeping with another girl&nbsp;</p>
<p>and she had taken it hard. The larger one was supposed to have left for&nbsp;</p>
<p>the mountains of Nagano last night for her brother's wedding, but she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had decided to spend the night with her depressed friend and take the&nbsp;</p>
<p>first express on Sunday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's too bad what you're going through," I said to the small one, "but&nbsp;</p>
<p>how did you find out your boyfriend was sleeping with someone&nbsp;</p>
<p>else?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking little sips of sake, the girl tore at some weeds underfoot. "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't have to work anything out," she said. "I opened his door, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>there he was, doing it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When was that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The night before last."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way. The door was unlocked?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder why he didn't lock it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How the hell should I know?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, how's she supposed to feel?" said the larger one, who seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>100&nbsp;</p>
<p>truly concerned for her friend. "What a shock it must have been for&nbsp;</p>
<p>her. Don't you think it's terrible?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really can't say," I answered. "You ought to have a good talk with&nbsp;</p>
<p>your boyfriend. Then it's a question of whether you forgive him or&nbsp;</p>
<p>not."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nobody knows how I feel," spat out the little one, still tearing grass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A flock of crows appeared from the west and sailed over a big&nbsp;</p>
<p>department store. It was daylight now. The time for the train to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagano was approaching, so we gave what was left of the sake to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>homeless guy downstairs at the west exit, bought platform tickets and&nbsp;</p>
<p>went in to see the big girl off. After the train pulled out of sight, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>small girl and I somehow ended up going to a nearby hotel. Neither of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us was particularly dying to sleep with the other, but it seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>necessary to bring things to a close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I undressed first and sat in the bath drinking beer with a vengeance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She got in with me and did the same, the two of us stretched out and&nbsp;</p>
<p>guzzling beer in silence. We couldn't seem to get drunk, though, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>neither of us was sleepy. Her skin was very fair and smooth, and she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had beautiful legs. I complimented her on her legs, but her "Thanks"&nbsp;</p>
<p>was little more than a grunt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we were in bed, though, she was like a different person. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>responded to the slightest touch of my hands, writhing and moaning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went inside her, she dug her nails into my back, and as her&nbsp;</p>
<p>orgasm approached she called out another man's name exactly 16&nbsp;</p>
<p>times. I concentrated on counting them as a way to delay my own&nbsp;</p>
<p>orgasm. Then the two of us fell asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was gone when I woke at 12.30. I found no note of any kind. One&nbsp;</p>
<p>side of my head felt strangely heavy from having drunk at an odd&nbsp;</p>
<p>hour. I took a shower to wake myself, shaved and sat in a chair, naked,&nbsp;</p>
<p>drinking a bottle of juice from the fridge and reviewing in order the&nbsp;</p>
<p>events of the night before. Each scene felt unreal and strangely distant,&nbsp;</p>
<p>as though I were viewing it through two or three layers of glass, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>101&nbsp;</p>
<p>the events had undoubtedly happened to me. The beer glasses were&nbsp;</p>
<p>still sitting on the table, and a used toothbrush lay by the sink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ate a light lunch in Shinjuku and went to a telephone box to call&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori Kobayashi on the off chance that she might be home alone&nbsp;</p>
<p>waiting for a call again today. I let it ring 15 times but no one&nbsp;</p>
<p>answered. I tried again 20 minutes later with the same results. Then I&nbsp;</p>
<p>took a bus back to the dorm. A special delivery letter was waiting for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me in the letterbox by the entry. It was from Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your letter, wrote Naoko. Her family had forwarded it&nbsp;</p>
<p>here, she said. Far from upsetting her, its arrival had made her very&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy, and in fact she had been on the point of writing to me herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having read that much, I opened the window, took off my jacket and&nbsp;</p>
<p>sat on the bed. I could hear pigeons cooing in a nearby roost. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>breeze stirred the curtains. Holding the seven pages of writing paper&nbsp;</p>
<p>from Naoko, I gave myself up to an endless stream of feelings. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed as if the colours of the real world around me had begun to&nbsp;</p>
<p>drain away from my having done nothing more than read a few lines&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had written. I closed my eyes and spent a long time collecting my&nbsp;</p>
<p>thoughts. Finally, after one deep breath, I continued reading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's almost four months since I came here, she went on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've thought a lot about you in that time. The more I've thought, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>more I've come to feel that I was unfair to you. I probably should have&nbsp;</p>
<p>been a better, fairer person when it came to the way I treated you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may not be the most normal way to look at things, though. Girls&nbsp;</p>
<p>my age never use the word "fair". Ordinary girls as young as I am are&nbsp;</p>
<p>basically indifferent to whether things are fair or not. The central&nbsp;</p>
<p>102&nbsp;</p>
<p>question for them is not whether something is fair but whether or not&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's beautiful or will make them happy. "Fair" is a man's word, finally,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I can't help feeling that it is also exactly the right word for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>now. And because questions of beauty and happiness have become&nbsp;</p>
<p>such difficult and convoluted propositions for me now, I suspect, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>find myself clinging instead to other standards - like, whether or not&nbsp;</p>
<p>something is fair or honest or universally true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, though, I believe that I have not been fair to you and that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>as a result, I must have led you around in circles and hurt you deeply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In doing so, however, I have led myself around in circles and hurt&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself just as deeply. I say this not as an excuse or a means of self</p>
<p>justification but because it is true. If I have left a wound inside you, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>is not just your wound but mine as well. So please try not to hate me. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>am a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you&nbsp;</p>
<p>realize. Which is precisely why I do not want you to hate me. Because&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you were to do that, I would really go to pieces. I can't do what you&nbsp;</p>
<p>can do: I can't slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass. I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>know for a fact that you are really like that, but sometimes you give&nbsp;</p>
<p>me that impression. I often envy that in you, which may be why I led&nbsp;</p>
<p>you around in circles so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be an over-analytical way of looking at things. Don't you&nbsp;</p>
<p>agree? The therapy they perform here is certainly not over-analytical,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but when you are under treatment for several months the way I am&nbsp;</p>
<p>here, like it or not, you become more or less analytical. "This was&nbsp;</p>
<p>caused by that, and that means this, because of which such-and-such."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like that. I can't tell whether this kind of analysis is trying to simplify&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world or complicate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, I myself feel that I am far closer to recovery than I once&nbsp;</p>
<p>was, and people here tell me this is true. This is the first time in a long&nbsp;</p>
<p>while I have been able to sit down and calmly write a letter. The one I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrote you in July was something I had to squeeze out of me (though,&nbsp;</p>
<p>to tell the truth, I don't remember what I wrote - was it terrible?), but&nbsp;</p>
<p>103&nbsp;</p>
<p>this time I am very, very calm. Clean air, a quiet world cut off from&nbsp;</p>
<p>the outside, a daily schedule for living, regular exercise: those are&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I needed, it seems. How wonderful it is to be able to write&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone a letter! To feel like conveying your thoughts to a person, to&nbsp;</p>
<p>sit at your desk and pick up a pen, to put your thoughts into words like&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is truly marvellous. Of course, once I do put them into words, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>find I can only express a fraction of what I want to say, but that's all&nbsp;</p>
<p>right. I'm happy just to be able to feel I want to write to someone. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I am writing to you. It's 7.30 in the evening, I've had my dinner and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just finished my bath. The place is silent, and it's pitch black&nbsp;</p>
<p>outside. I can't see a single light through the window. I usually have a&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear view of the stars from here, but not today, with the clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone here knows a lot about the stars, and they tell me "That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virgo" or "That's Sagittarius". They probably learn whether they want&nbsp;</p>
<p>to or not because there's nothing to do here once the sun goes down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is also why they know so much about birds and flowers and&nbsp;</p>
<p>insects. Speaking to them, I realize how ignorant I was about such&nbsp;</p>
<p>things, which is kind of nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are about 70 people living here. In addition, the staff (doctors,&nbsp;</p>
<p>nurses, office staff, etc.) come to just over 20. It's such a wide-open&nbsp;</p>
<p>place, these are not big numbers at all. Far from it: it might be more&nbsp;</p>
<p>accurate to say the place is on the empty side. It's big and filled with&nbsp;</p>
<p>nature and everybody lives quietly - so quietly you sometimes feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>that this is the normal, real world, which of course it's not. We can&nbsp;</p>
<p>have it this way because we live here under certain preconditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I play tennis and basketball. Basketball teams are made up of both&nbsp;</p>
<p>staff and (I hate the word, but there's no way around it) patients. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm absorbed in a game, though, I lose track of who are the patients&nbsp;</p>
<p>and who are staff. This is kind of strange. I know this will sound&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange, but when I look at the people around me during a game, they&nbsp;</p>
<p>all look equally deformed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said this one day to the doctor in charge of my case, and he told me&nbsp;</p>
<p>104&nbsp;</p>
<p>that, in a sense, what I was feeling was right, that we are in here not to&nbsp;</p>
<p>correct the deformation but to accustom ourselves to it: that one of our&nbsp;</p>
<p>problems was our inability to recognize and accept our own&nbsp;</p>
<p>deformities. Just as each person has certain idiosyncrasies in the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>he or she walks, people have idiosyncrasies in the way they think and&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel and see things, and though you might want to correct them, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>doesn't happen overnight, and if you try to force the issue in one case,&nbsp;</p>
<p>something else might go funny. He gave me a very simplified&nbsp;</p>
<p>explanation, of course, and it's just one small part of the problems we&nbsp;</p>
<p>have, but I think I understand what he was trying to say. It may well&nbsp;</p>
<p>be that we can never fully adapt to our own deformities. Unable to&nbsp;</p>
<p>find a place inside ourselves for the very real pain and suffering that&nbsp;</p>
<p>these deformities cause, we come here to get away from such things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as we are here, we can get by without hurting others or being&nbsp;</p>
<p>hurt by them because we know that we are "deformed". That's what&nbsp;</p>
<p>distinguishes us from the outside world: most people go about their&nbsp;</p>
<p>lives unconscious of their deformities, while in this little world of ours&nbsp;</p>
<p>the deformities themselves are a precondition. Just as Indians wear&nbsp;</p>
<p>feathers on their heads to show what tribe they belong to, we wear our&nbsp;</p>
<p>deformities in the open. And we live quietly so as not to hurt one&nbsp;</p>
<p>another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to playing sports, we all participate in growing vegetables:&nbsp;</p>
<p>tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, watermelons, strawberries, spring&nbsp;</p>
<p>onions, cabbage, daikon radishes, and so on and on. We grow just&nbsp;</p>
<p>about everything. We use greenhouses, too. The people here know a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot about&nbsp; vegetable farming, and they put a lot of energy into it. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>read books on the subject and call in experts and talk from morning to&nbsp;</p>
<p>night about which fertilizer to use and the condition of the soil and&nbsp;</p>
<p>stuff like that. I have come to love growing vegetables. It's great to&nbsp;</p>
<p>watch different fruits and vegetables getting bigger and bigger each&nbsp;</p>
<p>day. Have you ever grown watermelons? They swell up, just like&nbsp;</p>
<p>some kind of little animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>105&nbsp;</p>
<p>We eat freshly picked fruits and vegetables every day. They also serve&nbsp;</p>
<p>meat and fish of course, but when you're living here you feel less and&nbsp;</p>
<p>less like eating those because the vegetables are so fresh and&nbsp;</p>
<p>delicious. Sometimes we go out and gather wild plants and&nbsp;</p>
<p>mushrooms. We have experts on that kind of thing (come to think of&nbsp;</p>
<p>it, this place is crawling with experts) who tell us which plants to pick&nbsp;</p>
<p>and which to avoid. As a result of all this, I've gained over six pounds&nbsp;</p>
<p>since I got here. My weight is just about perfect, thanks to the exercise&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the good eating on a regular schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we're not farming, we read or listen to music or knit. We don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have TV or radio, but we do have a very decent library with books and&nbsp;</p>
<p>records. The record collection has everything from Mahler&nbsp;</p>
<p>symphonies to the Beatles, and I'm always borrowing records to listen&nbsp;</p>
<p>to in my room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one real problem with this place is that once you're here you don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to leave - or you're afraid to leave. As long as we're here, we feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>calm and peaceful. Our deformities seem natural. We think we've&nbsp;</p>
<p>recovered. But we can never be sure that the outside world will accept&nbsp;</p>
<p>us in the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My doctor says it's time I began having contact with "outside people" - meaning normal people in the normal world. When he says that, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>only face I see is yours. To tell the truth, I don't want to see my&nbsp;</p>
<p>parents. They're too upset over me, and seeing them puts me in a bad&nbsp;</p>
<p>mood. Plus, there are things I have to explain to you. I'm not sure I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can explain them very well, but they're important things I can't go on&nbsp;</p>
<p>avoiding any longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, you shouldn't feel that I'm a burden to you. The one thing I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to be is a burden to anyone. I can sense the good feelings you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have for me. They make me very happy. All I am doing in this letter is&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to convey that happiness to you. Those good feelings of yours&nbsp;</p>
<p>are probably just what I need at this point in my life. Please forgive&nbsp;</p>
<p>me if anything I've written here upsets you. As I said before, I am a far&nbsp;</p>
<p>106&nbsp;</p>
<p>more flawed human being than you realize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder: IF you and I had met under absolutely ordinary&nbsp;</p>
<p>circumstances, and IF we had liked each other, what would have&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened? IF I had been normal and you had been normal (which, of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, you are) and there had been no Kizuki, what would have&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened? Of course, this "IF" is way too big. I'm trying hard at least&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be fair and honest. It's all I can do at this point. I hope to convey&nbsp;</p>
<p>some small part of my feelings to you this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike an ordinary hospital, this place has free visiting hours. As long&nbsp;</p>
<p>as you call the day before, you can come any time. You can even eat&nbsp;</p>
<p>with me, and there's a place for you to stay. Please come and see me&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometime when it's convenient for you. I look forward to seeing you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm enclosing a map. Sorry this turned into such a long letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read Naoko's letter all the way through, and then I read it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I went downstairs, bought a Coke from the vending&nbsp;</p>
<p>machine, and drank it while reading the letter one more time. I put the&nbsp;</p>
<p>seven pages of writing paper back into the envelope and laid it on my&nbsp;</p>
<p>desk. My name and address had been written on the pink envelope in&nbsp;</p>
<p>perfect, tiny characters that were just a bit too precisely formed for&nbsp;</p>
<p>those of a girl. I sat at my desk, studying the envelope. The return&nbsp;</p>
<p>address on the back said Ami Hostel. An odd name. I thought about it&nbsp;</p>
<p>for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>few minutes, concluding that the "ami" must be from the French word&nbsp;</p>
<p>for "friend".&nbsp;</p>
<p>After putting the letter away in my desk drawer, I changed clothes and&nbsp;</p>
<p>went out. I was afraid that if I stayed near the letter I would end up&nbsp;</p>
<p>reading it 10, 20, who knew how many times? I walked the streets of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo on Sunday without a destination in mind, as I had always done&nbsp;</p>
<p>with Naoko. I wandered from one street to the next, recalling her letter&nbsp;</p>
<p>line by line and mulling each sentence over as best I could. When the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sun went down, I returned to the dorm and made a long-distance call&nbsp;</p>
<p>107&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the Ami Hostel. A woman receptionist answered and asked my&nbsp;</p>
<p>business. I asked if it might be possible for me to visit Naoko the&nbsp;</p>
<p>following afternoon. I left my name and she said I should call back in&nbsp;</p>
<p>half an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same woman answered when I called back after dinner. It would&nbsp;</p>
<p>indeed be possible for me to see Naoko, she said. I thanked her, hung&nbsp;</p>
<p>up, and put a change of clothes and a few toiletries in my rucksack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I picked up The Magic Mountain again, reading and sipping&nbsp;</p>
<p>brandy and waiting to get sleepy. Even so, I didn't fall asleep until&nbsp;</p>
<p>after one o'clock in the morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>108&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as I woke at seven o'clock on Monday morning, I washed my&nbsp;</p>
<p>face, shaved, and went straight to the dorm Head's room without&nbsp;</p>
<p>eating breakfast to say that I was going to be gone for two days hiking&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the hills. He was used to my taking short trips when I had free time,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and reacted without surprise. I took a crowded commuter train to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo Station and bought a bullet-train ticket to Kyoto, literally&nbsp;</p>
<p>jumping onto the first Hikari express to pull out. I made do with&nbsp;</p>
<p>coffee and a sandwich for breakfast and dozed for an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I arrived in Kyoto a few minutes before eleven. Following Naoko's&nbsp;</p>
<p>instructions, I took a city bus to a small terminal serving the northern&nbsp;</p>
<p>suburbs. The next bus to my destination would not be leaving until&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.35, I was told, and the trip would take a little over an hour. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>bought a ticket and went to a bookshop across the street for a map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the waiting room, I studied the map to see if I could find&nbsp;</p>
<p>exactly where the Ami Hostel was located. It turned out to be much&nbsp;</p>
<p>farther into the mountains than I had imagined. The bus would have to&nbsp;</p>
<p>cross several hills in its trek north, then turn around where the canyon&nbsp;</p>
<p>road dead-ended and return to the city. My stop would be just before&nbsp;</p>
<p>the end of the line. There was a footpath near the bus stop, according&nbsp;</p>
<p>to Naoko, and if I followed it for 20 minutes I would reach Ami&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hostel. No&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonder it was such a quiet place, if it was that deep in the mountains!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bus pulled out with about 20 passengers aboard, following the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kamo River through the north end of Kyoto. The tightly packed city&nbsp;</p>
<p>streets gave way to more sparse housing, then fields and vacant land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black tile roofs and vinyl-sided greenhouses caught the early autumn&nbsp;</p>
<p>sun and sent it back with a glare. When the bus entered the canyon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the driver began hauling the steering wheel this way and that to follow&nbsp;</p>
<p>the twists and curves of the road, and I began to feel queasy. I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>109&nbsp;</p>
<p>still taste my morning coffee. By the time the number of curves began&nbsp;</p>
<p>to decrease to the point where I felt some relief, the bus plunged into a&nbsp;</p>
<p>chilling cedar forest. The trees might have been old growth the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>they towered over the road, blocking out the sun and covering&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything in gloomy shadows. The breeze flowing into the bus's open&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows turned suddenly cold, its dampness sharp against the skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The valley road hugged the river bank, continuing so long through the&nbsp;</p>
<p>trees it began to seem as if the whole world had been buried for ever&nbsp;</p>
<p>in cedar forest - at which point the forest ended, and we came to an&nbsp;</p>
<p>open basin surrounded by mountain peaks. Broad, green farmland&nbsp;</p>
<p>spread out in all directions, and the river by the road looked bright and&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear. A single thread of white smoke rose in the distance. Some&nbsp;</p>
<p>houses had laundry drying in the sun, and dogs were howling. Each&nbsp;</p>
<p>farmhouse had firewood out front piled up to the eaves, usually with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cat resting somewhere on the pile. The road was lined with such&nbsp;</p>
<p>houses for a time, but I saw not a single person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scenery repeated this pattern any number of times. The bus would&nbsp;</p>
<p>enter cedar forest, come out to a village, then go back into forest. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>would stop at a village to let people off, but no one ever got on. Forty&nbsp;</p>
<p>minutes after leaving the city, the bus reached a mountain pass with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>wide-open view. The driver stopped the bus and announced that we&nbsp;</p>
<p>would be waiting there for five or six minutes: people could step down&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the bus if they wished. There were only four passengers left now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>including me. We all got out and stretched or smoked and looked&nbsp;</p>
<p>down at the panorama of Kyoto far below. The driver went off to one&nbsp;</p>
<p>side for a pee. A suntanned man in his early fifties who had boarded&nbsp;</p>
<p>the bus with a big, rope-tied cardboard carton asked me if I was going&nbsp;</p>
<p>out to hike in the mountains. I said yes to keep things simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually another bus came climbing up from the other side of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>pass and stopped next to ours. The driver got out, had a short talk with&nbsp;</p>
<p>our driver, and the two men climbed back into their buses. The four of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us returned to our seats, and the buses pulled out in opposite&nbsp;</p>
<p>110&nbsp;</p>
<p>directions. It was not immediately clear to me why our bus had had to&nbsp;</p>
<p>wait for the other one, but a short way down the other side of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>mountain the road narrowed suddenly. Two big buses could never&nbsp;</p>
<p>have passed each other on the road, and in fact passing ordinary cars&nbsp;</p>
<p>coming in the other direction required a good deal of manoeuvring,&nbsp;</p>
<p>with one or the other vehicle having to back up and squeeze into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>overhang of a curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The villages along the road were far smaller now, and the level areas&nbsp;</p>
<p>under cultivation even narrower. The mountain was steeper, its walls&nbsp;</p>
<p>pressed closer to the bus windows. They seemed to have just as many&nbsp;</p>
<p>dogs as the other places, though, and the arrival of the bus would set&nbsp;</p>
<p>off a howling competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the stop where I got off, there was nothing - no houses, no fields,&nbsp;</p>
<p>just the bus stop sign, a little stream, and the trail opening. I slung my&nbsp;</p>
<p>rucksack over my shoulder and started up the track. The stream ran&nbsp;</p>
<p>along the left side of the trail, and a forest of deciduous trees lined the&nbsp;</p>
<p>right. I had been climbing&nbsp;</p>
<p>the gentle slope for some 15 minutes when I came to a road leading&nbsp;</p>
<p>into the woods on the right, the opening barely wide enough to&nbsp;</p>
<p>accommodate a car. AMI HOSTEL PRIVATE&nbsp; NO TRESPASSING&nbsp;</p>
<p>read the sign by the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharply etched tyre tracks ran up the road through the trees. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>occasional flapping of wings echoed in the woods. The sound came&nbsp;</p>
<p>through with strange clarity, as if amplified above the other voices of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the forest. Once, from far away, I heard what might have been a rifle&nbsp;</p>
<p>shot, but it was a small and muffled sound, as though it had passed&nbsp;</p>
<p>through several filters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the woods I came to a white stone wall. It was no higher than&nbsp;</p>
<p>my own height and, lacking additional barriers on top, would have&nbsp;</p>
<p>been easy for me to scale. The black iron gate looked sturdy enough,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but it was wide open, and there was no one manning the guardhouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another sign like the last one stood by the gate: AMI HOSTEL&nbsp;</p>
<p>111&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRIVATE&nbsp; NO TRESPASSING. A few clues suggested the guard had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been there until some moments before: the ashtray held three butt</p>
<p>ends, a tea cup stood there half empty, a transistor radio sat on a shelf,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the clock on the wall ticked off the time with a dry sound. I waited&nbsp;</p>
<p>a while for the person to come back, but when that showed no sign of&nbsp;</p>
<p>happening, I gave a few pushes to something that looked as if it might&nbsp;</p>
<p>be a bell. The area just inside the gate was a car park. In it stood a&nbsp;</p>
<p>mini-bus, a four-wheel drive Land Cruiser, and a dark blue Volvo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The car park could have held 30 cars, but only those three were parked&nbsp;</p>
<p>there now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two or three minutes went by, and then a gatekeeper in a navy-blue&nbsp;</p>
<p>uniform came down the forest road on a yellow bicycle. He was a tall&nbsp;</p>
<p>man in his early sixties with receding hair. He leaned the yellow bike&nbsp;</p>
<p>against the guardhouse and said, "I'm very sorry to have kept you&nbsp;</p>
<p>waiting," though he didn't sound sorry at all. The number 32 was&nbsp;</p>
<p>painted in white on the bike's mudguard. When I gave him my name,&nbsp;</p>
<p>he picked up the phone and repeated it twice to someone on the other&nbsp;</p>
<p>end, replied "Yes, uh-huh, I see" to the other person, then hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Go to the main building, please, and ask for Doctor Ishida," he said&nbsp;</p>
<p>to me. "You take this road through the trees to a roundabout. Then&nbsp;</p>
<p>take your second left - got that? Your second left - from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>roundabout. You'll see an old house. Turn right and go through&nbsp;</p>
<p>another bunch of trees to a concrete building. That's the main building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's easy, just watch for the signs."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the second left from the roundabout as instructed, and where&nbsp;</p>
<p>that path ended I came to an interesting old building that obviously&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been someone's country house once. It had a manicured garden&nbsp;</p>
<p>with well-shaped rocks and a stone lantern. It must have been a&nbsp;</p>
<p>country estate. Turning right through the trees, I saw a three-storey&nbsp;</p>
<p>concrete building. It stood in a hollowed-out area, and so there was&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing overwhelming about its three storeys. It was simple in design&nbsp;</p>
<p>and gave a strong impression of cleanliness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>112&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entrance was on the second floor. I climbed the stairs and went in&nbsp;</p>
<p>through a big glass door to find a young woman in a red dress at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>reception desk. I gave her my name and said I had been instructed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>ask for Doctor Ishida. She smiled and gestured towards a brown sofa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>suggesting in low tones that I wait there for the doctor to come. Then&nbsp;</p>
<p>she dialled a number. I lowered my rucksack from my back, sank&nbsp;</p>
<p>down into the deep cushions of the sofa, and surveyed the place. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a clean, pleasant lobby, with ornamental potted plants, tasteful&nbsp;</p>
<p>abstract paintings, and a polished floor. As I waited, I kept my eyes on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the floor's reflection of my shoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point the receptionist assured me, "The doctor will be here&nbsp;</p>
<p>soon." I nodded. What an incredibly quiet place! There were no&nbsp;</p>
<p>sounds of any kind. It was as though everyone were taking a siesta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People, animals, insects, plants must all be sound asleep, I thought, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was such a quiet afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before long, though, I heard the soft padding of rubber soles, and a&nbsp;</p>
<p>mature, bristly-haired woman appeared. She swept across the lobby,&nbsp;</p>
<p>sat down next to me, crossed her legs and took my hand. Instead of&nbsp;</p>
<p>just shaking it, she turned my hand over, examining it front and back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You haven't played a musical instrument, at least not for some years&nbsp;</p>
<p>now, have you?" were the first words out of her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No," I said, taken aback. "You're right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can tell from your hands," she said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was something almost mysterious about this woman. Her face&nbsp;</p>
<p>had lots of wrinkles. These were the first thing to catch your eye, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>they didn't make her look old. Instead, they emphasized a certain&nbsp;</p>
<p>youthfulness in her that transcended age. The wrinkles belonged&nbsp;</p>
<p>where they were, as if they had been part of her face since birth. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>she smiled, the wrinkles smiled with her; when she frowned, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrinkles frowned, too. And when she was neither smiling nor frown</p>
<p>ing, the wrinkles lay scattered over her face in a strangely warm,&nbsp;</p>
<p>ironic way. Here was a woman in her late thirties who seemed not&nbsp;</p>
<p>113&nbsp;</p>
<p>merely a nice person but whose niceness drew you to her. I liked her&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the moment I saw her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wildly chopped, her hair stuck out in patches and the fringe lay&nbsp;</p>
<p>crooked against her forehead, but the style suited her perfectly. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>wore a blue work shirt over a white T-shirt, baggy, cream-coloured&nbsp;</p>
<p>cotton trousers, and tennis shoes. Long and slim, she had almost no&nbsp;</p>
<p>breasts. Her lips moved constantly to one side in a kind of ironic curl,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes moved in tiny twitches. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>looked like a kindly, skilled, but somewhat world-weary female&nbsp;</p>
<p>carpenter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chin drawn in and lips curled, she took some time to look me over&nbsp;</p>
<p>from head to toe. I imagined that any minute now she was going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>whip out her tape measure and start measuring me everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Can you play an instrument?" she asked. "Sorry, no," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Too bad," she said. "It would have been fun."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose so," I said. Why all this talk about musical instruments?&nbsp;</p>
<p>She took a pack of Seven Stars from her breast pocket, put one&nbsp;</p>
<p>between her lips, lit it with a lighter and began puffing away with&nbsp;</p>
<p>obvious pleasure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It crossed my mind that I should tell you about this place, Mr. -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watanabe, wasn't it? - before you see Naoko. So I arranged for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>two of us to have this little talk. Ami Hostel is kind of unusual - you&nbsp;</p>
<p>might find it a little confusing without any background knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm right, aren't I, in supposing that you don't know anything about&nbsp;</p>
<p>this place?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Almost nothing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, then, first of all - " she began, then snapped her fingers. "Come&nbsp;</p>
<p>to think of it, have you had lunch? I'll bet you're hungry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're right, I am."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come with me, then. We can talk over food in the dining hall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lunchtime is over, but if we go now they can still make us&nbsp;</p>
<p>something."&nbsp;</p>
<p>114&nbsp;</p>
<p>She took the lead, hurrying down a corridor and a flight of stairs to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>first-floor dining hall. It was a large room, with enough space for&nbsp;</p>
<p>perhaps 200 people, but only half was in use, the other half partitioned&nbsp;</p>
<p>off, like a resort hotel out of season. The day's menu listed a potato&nbsp;</p>
<p>stew with noodles, salad, orange juice and bread. The vegetables&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned out to be as delicious as Naoko had said in her letter, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>finished everything on my plate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You obviously enjoy your food!" said my female companion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's wonderful," I said. "Plus, I've hardly eaten anything all day."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're welcome to mine if you like. I'm full. Here, go ahead."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I will, if you really don't want it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've got a small stomach. It doesn't hold much. I make up for what&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm missing with cigarettes." She lit another Seven Star. "Oh, by the&nbsp;</p>
<p>way, you can call me Reiko. Everybody does."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko seemed to derive great pleasure from watching me while I ate&nbsp;</p>
<p>the potato stew she had hardly touched and munched on her bread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you Naoko's doctor?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Me?! Naoko's doctor?!" She screwed up her face. "What makes you&nbsp;</p>
<p>think I'm a doctor?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They told me to ask for Doctor Ishida."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, I get it. No no no, I teach music here. It's a kind of therapy for&nbsp;</p>
<p>some patients, so for fun they call me "The Music Doctor' and&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes "Doctor Ishida'. But I'm just another patient. I've been here&nbsp;</p>
<p>seven years. I work as a music teacher and help out in the office, so&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's hard to tell any more whether I'm a patient or staff. Didn't Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell you about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's strange," said Reiko. "I'm Naoko's room-mate. I like living&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her. We talk about all kinds of things. Including you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, first I have to tell you about this place," said Reiko, ignoring&nbsp;</p>
<p>115&nbsp;</p>
<p>my question. "The first thing you ought to know is that this is no&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordinary "hospital'. It's not so much for treatment as for&nbsp;</p>
<p>convalescence. We do have a few doctors, of course, and they give&nbsp;</p>
<p>hourly sessions, but they're just checking people's conditions, taking&nbsp;</p>
<p>their temperature and things like that, not administering "treatments'&nbsp;</p>
<p>as in an ordinary hospital. There are no bars on the windows here, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the gate is always wide open. People enter and leave voluntarily. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to be suited to that kind of convalescence to be admitted here in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first place. In some cases, people who need specialized therapy&nbsp;</p>
<p>end up going to a specialized hospital. OK so far?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think so," I said. "But what does this "convalescence' consist of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you give me a concrete example?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko exhaled a cloud of smoke and drank what was left of her orange&nbsp;</p>
<p>juice. "Just living here is the convalescence," she said. A regular&nbsp;</p>
<p>routine, exercise, isolation from the outside world, clean air, quiet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our farmland makes us practically self-sufficient; there's no TV or&nbsp;</p>
<p>radio. We're like one of those commune places you hear so much&nbsp;</p>
<p>about. Of course, one thing different from a commune is that it costs a&nbsp;</p>
<p>bundle to get in here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bundle?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, it's not ridiculously expensive, but it's not cheap. Just look at&nbsp;</p>
<p>these facilities. We've got a lot of land here, a few patients, a big staff,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and in my case I've been here a long time. True, I'm almost staff&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself so I get concessions, but still ... Now, how about a cup of&nbsp;</p>
<p>coffee?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I'd like some. She stubbed out her cigarette and went over to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>counter, where she poured two cups of coffee from a warm pot and&nbsp;</p>
<p>brought them back to where we were sitting. She put sugar in hers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>stirred it, frowned, and took&nbsp;</p>
<p>a sip. -You know," she said, "this sanatorium is not a profitmaking&nbsp;</p>
<p>enterprise, so it can keep going without charging as much as it might&nbsp;</p>
<p>116&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to otherwise. The land was a donation. They created a&nbsp;</p>
<p>corporation for the purpose. The whole place used to be the donor's&nbsp;</p>
<p>summer home about 20 years ago. You saw the old house, I'm sure?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That used to be the only building on the property. It's where they did&nbsp;</p>
<p>group therapy. That's how it all got started. The donor's son had a&nbsp;</p>
<p>tendency towards mental illness and a specialist recommended group&nbsp;</p>
<p>therapy for him. The doctor's theory was that if you could have a&nbsp;</p>
<p>group of patients living out in the country, helping each other with&nbsp;</p>
<p>physical labour and have a doctor for advice and check-ups, you could&nbsp;</p>
<p>cure certain kinds of sickness. They tried it, and the operation grew&nbsp;</p>
<p>and was incorporated, and they put more land under cultivation, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>put up the main building five years ago."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Meaning, the therapy worked."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, not for everything. Lots of people don't get better. But also a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot of people who couldn't be helped anywhere else managed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>complete recovery here. The best thing about this place is the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>everybody helps everybody else. Everybody knows they're flawed in&nbsp;</p>
<p>some way, and so they try to help each other. Other places don't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>that way, unfortunately. Doctors are doctors and patients are patients:&nbsp;</p>
<p>the patient looks for help to the doctor and the doctor gives his help to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the patient. Here, though, we all help each other. We're all each other's&nbsp;</p>
<p>mirrors, and the doctors are part of us. They watch us from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sidelines and they slip in to help us if they see we need something, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>it sometimes happens that we help them. Sometimes we're better at&nbsp;</p>
<p>something than they are. For example, I'm teaching one doctor to play&nbsp;</p>
<p>the piano and another patient is teaching a nurse French. That kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing. Patients with problems like ours are often blessed with special&nbsp;</p>
<p>abilities. So everyone here is equal - patients, staff - and you. You're&nbsp;</p>
<p>one of us while you're in here, so I help you and you help me." Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>smiled, gently flexing every wrinkle on her face. "You help Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Naoko helps you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>117&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What should I do, then? Give me an example."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"First you decide that you want to help and that you need to be helped&nbsp;</p>
<p>by the other person. Then you are totally honest. You will not lie, you&nbsp;</p>
<p>will not gloss over anything, you will not cover up anything that might&nbsp;</p>
<p>prove embarrassing to you. That's all there is to it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll try," I said. "But tell me, Reiko, why have you been in here for&nbsp;</p>
<p>seven years? Talking with you like this, I can't believe there's anything&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrong with you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not while the sun's up," she said with a sombre look. "But when&nbsp;</p>
<p>night comes, I start drooling and rolling on the floor." "Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous, I'm kidding," she said, shaking her head with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>look of disgust. "I'm completely well - for now, at least. I stay here&nbsp;</p>
<p>because I enjoy helping other people get well, teaching music,&nbsp;</p>
<p>growing vegetables. I like it here. We're all more or less friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to that, what have I got in the outside world? I'm 38, going&nbsp;</p>
<p>on 40. I'm not like Naoko. There's nobody waiting for me to get out,&nbsp;</p>
<p>no family to take me back. I don't have any work to speak of, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost no friends. And after seven years, I don't know what's going on&nbsp;</p>
<p>out there. Oh, I'll read a paper in the library every once in a while, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't set foot outside this property all that time. I wouldn't know&nbsp;</p>
<p>what to do if I left."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But maybe a new world would open up for you," I said. "It's worth a&nbsp;</p>
<p>try, don't you think?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm, you may be right," she said, turning her cigarette lighter over&nbsp;</p>
<p>and over in her hand. "But I've got my own set of problems. I can tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>you all about them sometime if you like."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded in response. "And Naoko," I said, "is she any better?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm, we think so. She was pretty confused at first and we had our&nbsp;</p>
<p>doubts for a while, but she's calmed down now and improved to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>point where she's able to express herself verbally. She's definitely&nbsp;</p>
<p>heading in the right direction. But she should have received treatment&nbsp;</p>
<p>a lot earlier. Her symptoms were already apparent from the time that&nbsp;</p>
<p>118&nbsp;</p>
<p>boyfriend of hers, Kizuki, killed himself. Her family should have seen&nbsp;</p>
<p>it, and she herself should have realized that something was wrong. Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, things weren't right at home, either ..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They weren't?" I shot back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You didn't know?" Reiko seemed more surprised than I was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd better let Naoko tell you about that herself. She's ready for some&nbsp;</p>
<p>honest talk with you." Reiko gave her coffee another stir and took a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sip. "There's one more thing you need to know," she said. "According&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the rules here, you and Naoko will not be allowed to be alone&nbsp;</p>
<p>together. Visitors can't be alone with patients. An observer always has&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be present - which in this case means me. I'm sorry, but you'll just&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to put up with me. OK?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK," I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But still," she said, "the two of you can talk about anything you'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>like. Forget I'm there. I know pretty much everything there is to know&nbsp;</p>
<p>about you and Naoko."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Everything?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pretty much. We have these group sessions, you know. So we learn a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot about each other. Plus Naoko and I talk about everything. We don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have many secrets here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at Reiko as I drank my coffee. "To tell you the truth," I said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm confused. I still don't know whether what I did to Naoko in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo was the right thing to do or not. I've been thinking about it this&nbsp;</p>
<p>whole time, but I still don't know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And neither do I," said Reiko. "And neither does Naoko. That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>something the two of you will have to decide for yourselves. See what&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean? Whatever happened, the two of you can turn it in the right&nbsp;</p>
<p>direction - if you can reach some kind of mutual understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe, once you've got that taken care of, you can go back and think&nbsp;</p>
<p>about whether what happened was the right thing or not. What do you&nbsp;</p>
<p>say?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>119&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think the three of us can help each other - you and Naoko and I - if&nbsp;</p>
<p>we really want to, and if we're really honest. It can be incredibly&nbsp;</p>
<p>effective when three people work at it like that. How long can you&nbsp;</p>
<p>stay?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, I'd like to get back to Tokyo by early evening the day after&nbsp;</p>
<p>tomorrow. I have to work, and I've got a German exam on Thursday."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good," she said. "So you can stay with us. That way it won't cost you&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything and you can talk without having to worry about the time."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With "us'?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Naoko and me, of course," said Reiko. "We have a separate bedroom,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and there's a sofa bed in the living room, so you'll be able to sleep&nbsp;</p>
<p>fine. Don't worry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>,,Do they allow that?" I asked. "Can a male visitor stay in a Woman's&nbsp;</p>
<p>room?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you're going to come in and rape us in the middle of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the night?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be silly."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So there's no problem, then. Stay in our place and we can have some&nbsp;</p>
<p>nice, long talks. That would be the best thing. Then we can really&nbsp;</p>
<p>understand each other. And I can play my guitar for you. I'm pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>good, you know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you sure I'm not going to be in the way?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko put her third Seven Star between her lips and lit it after&nbsp;</p>
<p>screwing up the corner of her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Naoko and I have already discussed this. The two of us together are&nbsp;</p>
<p>giving you a personal invitation to stay with us. Don't you think you&nbsp;</p>
<p>should just politely accept?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course, I'll be glad to."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko deepened the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes and looked at&nbsp;</p>
<p>me for a time. "You've got this funny way of talking," she said. "Don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell me you're trying to imitate that boy in Catcher in the Rye?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>120&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way!" I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko smiled too, cigarette in mouth. "You are a good person, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell that much from looking at you. I can tell these things after&nbsp;</p>
<p>seven years of watching people come and go here: there are people&nbsp;</p>
<p>who can open their hearts and people who can't. You're one of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ones who can. Or, more precisely, you can if you want to."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What happens when people open their hearts?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko clasped her hands together on the table, cigarette dangling from&nbsp;</p>
<p>her lips. She was enjoying this. "They get better," she said. Ash&nbsp;</p>
<p>dropped onto the table, but she seemed not to notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko and I left the main building, crossed a hill, and passed by a&nbsp;</p>
<p>pool, some tennis courts, and a basketball court. Two men - one thin&nbsp;</p>
<p>and middle-aged, the other young and fat were on a tennis court. Both&nbsp;</p>
<p>used their racquets well, but to me the game they were playing could&nbsp;</p>
<p>not have been tennis. It seemed as if the two of them had a special&nbsp;</p>
<p>interest in the bounce of tennis balls and were doing research in that&nbsp;</p>
<p>area. They slammed the ball back and forth with a kind of strange&nbsp;</p>
<p>concentration. Both were drenched in sweat. The young man, in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>end of the court closer to us, noticed Reiko and carne over. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>exchanged a few words, smiling. Near the court, a man with no&nbsp;</p>
<p>expression on his face was using a large mower to cut the grass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on, we came to a patch of woods where some 15 or 20 neat&nbsp;</p>
<p>little cottages stood at some distance from each other. The same kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of yellow bike the gatekeeper had been riding was parked at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>entrance to almost every house. "Staff members and their families live&nbsp;</p>
<p>here," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We have just about everything we need without going to the city,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said as we walked along. "Where food is concerned, as I said&nbsp;</p>
<p>before, we're practically self-sufficient. We get eggs from our own&nbsp;</p>
<p>chicken coop. We have books and records and exercise facilities, our&nbsp;</p>
<p>own convenience store, and every week barbers and beauticians come&nbsp;</p>
<p>to visit. We even have films at weekends. Anything special we need&nbsp;</p>
<p>121&nbsp;</p>
<p>we can ask a staff member to buy for us in town. Clothing we order&nbsp;</p>
<p>from catalogues. Living here is no problem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you can't go into town?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, that we can't do. Of course if there's something special, like we&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to go to the dentist or something, that's another matter, but as a&nbsp;</p>
<p>rule we can't go into town. Each person is completely free to leave this&nbsp;</p>
<p>place, but once you've left you can't come back. You burn your&nbsp;</p>
<p>bridges. You can't go off for a couple of days in town and expect to&nbsp;</p>
<p>come back. It only stands to reason, though. Everybody would be&nbsp;</p>
<p>coming and going."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the trees we came to a gentle slope along which, at irregular&nbsp;</p>
<p>intervals, was a row of two-storey wooden houses that had something&nbsp;</p>
<p>odd about them. What made them look strange it's hard to say, but that&nbsp;</p>
<p>was the first thing I felt when I saw them. My reaction was a lot like&nbsp;</p>
<p>what we feel when we see unreality painted in a pleasant way. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>occurred to me that this was what you might get if Walt Disney did an&nbsp;</p>
<p>animated version of a Munch painting. All the houses were exactly the&nbsp;</p>
<p>same shape and colour, nearly cubical, in perfect left-to-right&nbsp;</p>
<p>symmetry, with big front doors and lots of windows. The road twisted&nbsp;</p>
<p>its way among them like the artificial practice course of a driving&nbsp;</p>
<p>school. There was a well-manicured flowering shrubbery in front of&nbsp;</p>
<p>every house. The place was deserted, and curtains covered all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is called Area C. The women live here. Us! There are ten&nbsp;</p>
<p>houses, each containing four units, two people per unit. That's 80&nbsp;</p>
<p>people all together, but at the moment there are only 32 of us."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Quiet, isn't it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, there's nobody here now," Reiko said. "I've been given special&nbsp;</p>
<p>permission to move around freely like this, but everyone else is off&nbsp;</p>
<p>pursuing their individual schedules. Some are exercising, some are&nbsp;</p>
<p>gardening, some are in group therapy, some are out gathering wild&nbsp;</p>
<p>plants. Each person makes up his or her own schedule. Let's see,&nbsp;</p>
<p>122&nbsp;</p>
<p>what's Naoko doing now? I think she was supposed to be working on&nbsp;</p>
<p>new paint and wallpaper. I forget. There are a few jobs like that that&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't finish till five."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko walked into the building marked "C-7", climbed the stairs at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>far end of the hallway, and opened the door on the right, which was&nbsp;</p>
<p>unlocked. She showed me around the flat, a pleasant, if plain, four</p>
<p>room unit: living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bath. It had no extra&nbsp;</p>
<p>furniture or unnecessary decoration, but neither was the place severe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was nothing special about it, but being there was kind of like&nbsp;</p>
<p>being with Reiko: you could relax and let the tension leave your body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The living room had a sofa, a table, and a rocking chair. Another table&nbsp;</p>
<p>stood in the kitchen. Both tables had large ashtrays on them. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>bedroom had two beds, two desks and a closet. A small night table&nbsp;</p>
<p>stood between the beds with a reading lamp on top and a paperback&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned face down. The kitchen had a small electric cooker that&nbsp;</p>
<p>matched the fridge and was equipped for simple cooking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No bath, just a shower, but it's pretty impressive, wouldn't you say?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bath and laundry facilities are communal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's almost too impressive. My dorm room has a ceiling and a&nbsp;</p>
<p>window."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ah, but you haven't seen the winters here," said Reiko, touching my&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to guide me to the sofa and sitting down next to me. "They're&nbsp;</p>
<p>long and harsh. Nothing but snow and snow and more snow&nbsp;</p>
<p>everywhere you look. It gets damp and chills you to the bone. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>spend the winter shovelling snow. Mostly you stay inside where it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>warm and listen to music or talk or knit. If you didn't have this much&nbsp;</p>
<p>space, you'd suffocate. You'll see if you come here in the winter."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko gave a deep sigh as if picturing wintertime, then folded her&nbsp;</p>
<p>hands on her knees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This will be your bed," she said, patting the sofa. "We'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleep in the bedroom, and you'll sleep here. You should be all right,&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't you think?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>123&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sure I'll be fine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, that settles it," said Reiko. "We'll be back around five. Naoko and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I both have things to do until then. Do you mind staying here alone?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all. I'll study my German."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Reiko left, I stretched out on the sofa and closed my eyes. I lay&nbsp;</p>
<p>there steeping myself in the silence when, out of nowhere, I thought of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the time Kizuki and I went on a motorbike ride. That had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>autumn, too, I realized. Autumn how many years ago? Yes, four. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>recalled the smell of Kizuki's leather jacket and the racket made by&nbsp;</p>
<p>that red Yamaha 125cc bike. We went to a spot far down the coast,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and came back the same evening, exhausted. Nothing special&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened on the way, but I remembered it well. The sharp autumn&nbsp;</p>
<p>wind moaned in my ears, and looking up at the sky, my hands&nbsp;</p>
<p>clutching Kizuki's jacket, I felt as if I might be swept into outer space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lay there for a long time, letting my mind wander from one memory&nbsp;</p>
<p>to another. For some strange reason, lying in this room seemed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>bring back old memories that I had rarely if ever recalled before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of them were pleasant, but others carried a trace of sadness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How long did this go on? I was so immersed in that torrent of memory&nbsp;</p>
<p>(and it was a torrent, like a spring gushing out of the rocks) that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>failed to notice Naoko quietly open the door and come in. I opened my&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes, and there she was. I raised my head and looked into her eyes for&nbsp;</p>
<p>a time. She was sitting on the arm of the sofa, looking at me. At first I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought she might be an image spun into existence by my own&nbsp;</p>
<p>memories. But it was the real Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sleeping?" she whispered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No," I said, "just thinking." I sat up and asked, "How are you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm good," she said with a little smile like a pale, distant scene. "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't have much time, though. I'm not supposed to be here now. I just&nbsp;</p>
<p>got away for a minute, and I have to go back right away. Don't you&nbsp;</p>
<p>hate my hair?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all," I said. "It's cute." Her hair was in a simple schoolgirl&nbsp;</p>
<p>124&nbsp;</p>
<p>style, with one side held in place with a hairslide the way she used to&nbsp;</p>
<p>have it in the old days. It suited her very well, as if she had always&nbsp;</p>
<p>worn it that way. She looked like one of the beautiful little girls you&nbsp;</p>
<p>see in woodblock prints from the Middle Ages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's such a pain, I have Reiko cut it for me. Do you really think it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>cute?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My mother hates it." She opened the hairslide, let the hair hang&nbsp;</p>
<p>down, smoothed it with her fingers, and closed the hairslide again. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was shaped like a butterfly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wanted to see you alone before the three of us get together. Not that&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had anything special to say. I just wanted to see your face and get&nbsp;</p>
<p>used to having you here. Otherwise, I'd have trouble getting to know&nbsp;</p>
<p>you again. I'm so bad with people."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well?" I asked. "Is it working?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A little," she said, touching her hairslide again. "But time's up. I've&nbsp;</p>
<p>got to go."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Toru," she began, "I really want to thank you for coming to see me. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>makes me very happy. But if being here is any kind of burden to you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>you shouldn't hesitate to tell me so. This is a special place, and it has a&nbsp;</p>
<p>special system, and some people can't get into it. So if you feel like&nbsp;</p>
<p>that, please be honest and let me know. I won't be crushed. We're&nbsp;</p>
<p>honest with each other here. We tell each other all kinds of things with&nbsp;</p>
<p>complete honesty."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll tell you," I said. "I'll be honest."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko sat down and leaned against me on the sofa. When I put my&nbsp;</p>
<p>arm around her, she rested her head on my shoulder and pressed her&nbsp;</p>
<p>face to my neck. She stayed like that for a time, almost as if she were&nbsp;</p>
<p>taking my temperature. Holding her, I felt warm in the chest. After a&nbsp;</p>
<p>short while, she stood up without saying a word and went out through&nbsp;</p>
<p>the door as quietly as she had come in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>125&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Naoko gone, I went to sleep on the sofa. I hadn't intended to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>so, but I fell into the kind of deep sleep I had not had for a long time,&nbsp;</p>
<p>filled with a sense of Naoko's presence. In the kitchen were the dishes&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko used, in the bathroom was the toothbrush Naoko used, and in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the bedroom was the bed in which Naoko slept. Sleeping soundly in&nbsp;</p>
<p>this flat of hers, I wrung the fatigue from every cell of my body, drop&nbsp;</p>
<p>by drop. I dreamed of a butterfly dancing in the half-light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I awoke again, the hands of my watch were pointing to 4.35.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The light had changed, the wind had died, the shapes of the clouds&nbsp;</p>
<p>were different. I had sweated in my sleep, so I dried my face with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>small towel from my rucksack and put on a fresh vest. Going to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>kitchen, I drank some water and stood there looking through the&nbsp;</p>
<p>window over the sink. I was facing a window in the building opposite,&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the inside of which hung several paper cut-outs - a bird, a cloud, a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cow, a cat, all in skilful silhouette and joined together. As before,&nbsp;</p>
<p>there was no sign of anyone about, and there were no sounds of any&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind. I felt as if I were living alone in an extremely well-cared-for&nbsp;</p>
<p>ruin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People started coming back to Area C a little after five Looking out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the kitchen window, I saw three women passing below. All wore hats&nbsp;</p>
<p>that prevented me from telling their ages, but judging from their&nbsp;</p>
<p>voices, they were not very young. Shortly after they had disappeared&nbsp;</p>
<p>around a corner, four more women appeared from the same direction&nbsp;</p>
<p>and, like the first group, disappeared around the same corner. An&nbsp;</p>
<p>evening mood hung over everything. From the living room window I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could see trees and a line of hills. Above the ridge floated a border of&nbsp;</p>
<p>pale sunlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and Reiko came back together at 5.30. Naoko and I exchanged&nbsp;</p>
<p>proper greetings as if meeting for the first time. She seemed truly&nbsp;</p>
<p>embarrassed. Reiko noticed the book I had been reading and asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>what it was. Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, I told her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How could you bring a book like that to a place like this?" she&nbsp;</p>
<p>126&nbsp;</p>
<p>demanded. She was right, of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko then made coffee for the three of us. I told Naoko about Storm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trooper's sudden disappearance and about the last day I saw him,&nbsp;</p>
<p>when he gave me the firefly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry he's gone," she said. "I wanted to hear more stories about&nbsp;</p>
<p>him." Reiko asked who Storm Trooper was, so I told her about his&nbsp;</p>
<p>antics and got a big laugh from her. The world was at peace and filled&nbsp;</p>
<p>with laughter as long as Storm Trooper stories were being told.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At six we went to the dining hall in the main building for supper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and I had fried fish with green salad, boiled vegetables, rice&nbsp;</p>
<p>and miso soup. Reiko limited herself to pasta salad and coffee,&nbsp;</p>
<p>followed by another cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You don't need to eat so much as you get older," she said by way of&nbsp;</p>
<p>explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some 20 other people were there in the dining hall. A few newcomers&nbsp;</p>
<p>arrived as we ate, meanwhile some others left. Aside from the variety&nbsp;</p>
<p>in people's ages, the scene looked pretty much like that of the dining&nbsp;</p>
<p>hall in my dormitory. Where it differed was the uniform volume at&nbsp;</p>
<p>which people conversed. There were no loud voices and no whispers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>no one laughing out loud or crying out in shock, no one yelling with&nbsp;</p>
<p>exaggerated gestures, nothing but quiet conversations, all carrying on&nbsp;</p>
<p>at the same level. People were eating in groups of three to five, each&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a single speaker, to whom the others would listen with nods and&nbsp;</p>
<p>grunts of interest, and when that person had finished speaking, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>next would take up the conversation. I could not tell what they were&nbsp;</p>
<p>saying, but the way they said it reminded me of the strange tennis&nbsp;</p>
<p>game I had seen at noon. I wondered if Naoko spoke like this when&nbsp;</p>
<p>she was with them and, strangely enough, I felt a twinge of loneliness&nbsp;</p>
<p>mixed with jealousy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the table behind me, a balding man in white with the authentic air&nbsp;</p>
<p>of a doctor was holding forth to a nervouslooking young man in&nbsp;</p>
<p>glasses and a squirrel-faced woman of middle age on the effects of&nbsp;</p>
<p>127&nbsp;</p>
<p>weightlessness on the secretion of gastric juices. The two listened with&nbsp;</p>
<p>an occasional "My goodness" or "Really?" but the longer I listened to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the balding man's style of speaking, the less certain I became that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>even in his white coat, he was really a doctor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one in the dining hall paid me any special attention. No one stared&nbsp;</p>
<p>or even seemed to notice I was there. My presence must have been an&nbsp;</p>
<p>entirely natural event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just once, though, the man in white spun around and asked me, "How&nbsp;</p>
<p>long will you be staying?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Two nights," I said. "I'll be leaving on Wednesday."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's nice here this time of year, isn't it? But come again in winter. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>really nice when everything's white."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Naoko may be out of here by the time it snows," said Reiko to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"True, but still, the winter's really nice," he repeated with a sombre&nbsp;</p>
<p>expression. I felt increasingly unsure as to whether or not he was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>doctor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you people talk about?" I asked Reiko, who seemed to not&nbsp;</p>
<p>quite follow me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do we talk about? Just ordinary things. What happened that&nbsp;</p>
<p>day, or books we've read, or tomorrow's weather, you know. Don't tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>me you're wondering if people jump to their feet and shout stuff like:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It'll rain tomorrow if a polar bear eats the stars tonight!"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, no, of course not," I said. "I was just wondering what all these&nbsp;</p>
<p>quiet conversations were about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a quiet place, so people talk quietly," said Naoko. She made a&nbsp;</p>
<p>neat pile of fish bones at the edge of her plate and dabbed at her&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth with a handkerchief. "There's no need to raise your voice here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't have to convince anybody of anything, and you don't have&nbsp;</p>
<p>to attract anyone's attention."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess not," I said, but as I ate my meal in those quiet surroundings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was surprised to find myself missing the hum of people. I wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>128&nbsp;</p>
<p>hear laughter and people shouting for no reason and saying overblown&nbsp;</p>
<p>things. That was just the kind of noise I had become weary of in&nbsp;</p>
<p>recent months, but sitting here eating fish in this unnaturally quiet&nbsp;</p>
<p>room, I couldn't relax. The dining hall had all the atmosphere of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>specialized -machine-tool trade fair. People with a strong interest in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>specialist field came together in a specific place and exchanged&nbsp;</p>
<p>information understood only by themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the room after supper, Naoko and Reiko announced that they&nbsp;</p>
<p>would be going to the Area C communal bath and that if I didn't mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>having just a shower, I could use the one in their bathroom. I would do&nbsp;</p>
<p>that, I said, and after they were gone I undressed, showered, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>washed my hair. I found a Bill Evans album in the bookcase and was&nbsp;</p>
<p>listening to it while drying my hair when I realized that it was the&nbsp;</p>
<p>record I had played in Naoko's room on the night of her birthday, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>night she cried and I took her in my arms. That had been only six&nbsp;</p>
<p>months ago, but it felt like something from a much remoter past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it felt that way because I had thought about it so often - too&nbsp;</p>
<p>often, to the point where it had distorted my sense of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moon was so bright, I turned the lights off and stretched out on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sofa to listen to Bill Evans' piano. Streaming in through the&nbsp;</p>
<p>window, the moonlight cast long shadows and splashed the walls with&nbsp;</p>
<p>a touch of diluted Indian ink. I took a thin metal flask from my&nbsp;</p>
<p>rucksack, let my mouth fill with the brandy it contained, allowed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>warmth to move slowly down my throat to my stomach, and from&nbsp;</p>
<p>there felt it spreading to every extremity. After a final sip, I closed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>flask and returned it to my rucksack. Now the moonlight seemed to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>swaying with the music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Naoko and Reiko came back from the bath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh! It was so dark here, we thought you had packed your bags and&nbsp;</p>
<p>gone back to Tokyo!" exclaimed Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said. "I hadn't seen such a bright moon for years. I wanted&nbsp;</p>
<p>to look at it with the lights off."&nbsp;</p>
<p>129&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's lovely, though," said Naoko. "Reiko, do we still have those&nbsp;</p>
<p>candles from the last power cut?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Probably, in a kitchen drawer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko brought a large, white candle from the kitchen. I lit it, dripped&nbsp;</p>
<p>a little wax into a plate, and stood it up. Reiko used the flame to light a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarette. As the three of us sat facing the candle amid these hushed&nbsp;</p>
<p>surroundings, it began to seem as if we were the only ones left on&nbsp;</p>
<p>some far edge of the world. The still shadows of the moonlight and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>swaying shadows of the candlelight met and melded on the white&nbsp;</p>
<p>walls of the flat. Naoko and I sat next to each other on the sofa, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko settled into the rocking chair facing us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about some wine?" Reiko asked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're allowed to drink?" I asked with some surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, not really," said Reiko, scratching an earlobe with a hint of&nbsp;</p>
<p>embarrassment. "But they pretty much let it go. If it's just wine or beer&nbsp;</p>
<p>and you don't drink too much. I've got a friend on the staff who buys&nbsp;</p>
<p>me a little now and then."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We have our drinking parties," said Naoko with a mischievous air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just the two of us."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's nice," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko took a bottle of white wine from the fridge, opened it with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>corkscrew and brought three glasses. The wine had a clear, delicious&nbsp;</p>
<p>flavour that seemed almost homemade. When the record ended, Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>brought out a guitar from under her bed, and after tuning it with a look&nbsp;</p>
<p>of fondness for the instrument, she began to play a slow Bach fugue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She missed her fingering every now and then, but it was real Bach,&nbsp;</p>
<p>with real feeling - warm, intimate, and filled with the joy of&nbsp;</p>
<p>performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I started playing the guitar here," said Reiko. "There are no pianos in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the rooms, of course. I'm self-taught, and I don't have guitar hands, so&nbsp;</p>
<p>130&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll never get very good, but I really love the instrument. It's small and&nbsp;</p>
<p>simple and easy, kind of like a warm, little room."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She played one more short Bach piece, something from a suite. Eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the candle flame, sipping wine, listening to Reiko's Bach, I felt the&nbsp;</p>
<p>tension inside me slipping away. When Reiko ended the Bach, Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked her to play a Beatles song.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Request time," said Reiko, winking at me. "She makes me play&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beatles every day, like I'm her music slave."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite her protest, Reiko played a fine "Michelle".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's a good one," she said. "I really like that song." She took a sip&nbsp;</p>
<p>of wine and puffed her cigarette. "It makes me feel like I'm in a big&nbsp;</p>
<p>meadow in a soft rain."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then she played "Nowhere Man" and "Julia". Now and then as she&nbsp;</p>
<p>played, she would close her eyes and shake her head. Afterwards she&nbsp;</p>
<p>would return to the wine and the cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Play "Norwegian Wood'," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko brought a porcelain beckoning cat from the kitchen. It was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>coin bank, and Naoko dropped a ?100 piece from her purse into its&nbsp;</p>
<p>slot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's this all about?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a rule," said Naoko. "When I request "Norwegian Wood,' I have&nbsp;</p>
<p>to put ?100 into the bank. It's my favourite, so I make a point of&nbsp;</p>
<p>paying for it. I make a request when I really want to hear it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And that way I get my cigarette money!" said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko gave her fingers a good flexing and then played "Norwegian&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wood". Again she played with real feeling, but never allowed it to&nbsp;</p>
<p>become sentimental. I took ?100 coin from my pocket and dropped it&nbsp;</p>
<p>into the bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Reiko with a sweet smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That song can make me feel so sad," said Naoko. "I don't know, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>guess I imagine myself wandering in a deep wood. I'm all alone and&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's cold and dark, and nobody comes to save me. That's why Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>131&nbsp;</p>
<p>never plays it unless I request it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>132&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like Casablanca!" Reiko said with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She followed "Norwegian Wood" with a few bossa novas while I kept&nbsp;</p>
<p>my eyes on Naoko. As she had said in her letter, she looked healthier&nbsp;</p>
<p>than before, suntanned, her body firm from exercise and outdoor&nbsp;</p>
<p>work. Her eyes were the same deep clear pools they had always been,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and her small lips still trembled shyly, but overall her beauty had&nbsp;</p>
<p>begun to change to that of a mature woman. Almost gone now was the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sharp edge - the chilling sharpness of a thin blade - that could be&nbsp;</p>
<p>glimpsed in the shadows of her beauty, in place of which there now&nbsp;</p>
<p>hovered a uniquely soothing, quiet calm. I felt moved by this new,&nbsp;</p>
<p>gentle beauty of hers, and amazed to think that a woman could change&nbsp;</p>
<p>so much in the course of half a year. I felt as drawn to her as ever,&nbsp;</p>
<p>perhaps more than before, but the thought of what she had lost in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>meantime also gave me cause for regret. Never again would she have&nbsp;</p>
<p>that self-centred beauty that seems to take its own, independent course&nbsp;</p>
<p>in adolescent girls and no one else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko said she wanted to hear about how I was spending my days. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>talked about the student strike and Nagasawa. This was the first time I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had ever said anything about him to her. I found it challenging to give&nbsp;</p>
<p>her an accurate account of his odd humanity, his unique philosophy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and his uncentred morality, but Naoko seemed finally to grasp what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was trying to tell her. I hid the fact that I went out hunting girls with&nbsp;</p>
<p>him, revealing only that the one person in the dorm I spent any real&nbsp;</p>
<p>time with was this unusual guy. All the while, Reiko went through&nbsp;</p>
<p>another practice of the Bach fugue she had played before, taking&nbsp;</p>
<p>occasional breaks for wine and cigarettes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He sounds like a strange person," said Naoko. "He is strange," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "But you like him?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not sure," I said. "I guess I can't say I like him. Nagasawa is&nbsp;</p>
<p>beyond liking or not liking. He doesn't try to be liked. In that sense,&nbsp;</p>
<p>he's a very honest guy, stoic even. He doesn't try to fool anybody."&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Stoic' sleeping with all those girls? Now that is weird," said Naoko,&nbsp;</p>
<p>133&nbsp;</p>
<p>laughing. "How many girls has he slept with?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's probably up to 80 now," I said. "But in his case, the higher the&nbsp;</p>
<p>numbers go, the less each individual act seems to mean. Which is&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I think he's trying to accomplish."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you call that "stoic'?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For him it is."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko thought about my words for a minute. "I think he's a lot sicker&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the head than I am," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So do I," I said. "But he can put all of his warped qualities into a&nbsp;</p>
<p>logical system. He's brilliant. If you brought him here, he'd be out in&nbsp;</p>
<p>two days. "Oh, sure, I know all that,' he'd say. "I understand&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything you're doing here.' He's that kind of guy. The kind people&nbsp;</p>
<p>respect."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess I'm the opposite of brilliant," said Naoko. "I don't understand&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything they're doing here - any better than I understand myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's not because you're not smart," I said. "You're normal. I've got&nbsp;</p>
<p>tons of things I don't understand about myself. We're both normal:&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordinary."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko raised her feet to the edge of the sofa and rested her chin on&nbsp;</p>
<p>her knees. "I want to know more about you," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm just an ordinary guy - ordinary family, ordinary education,&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordinary face, ordinary exam results, ordinary thoughts in my head."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're such a big Scott Fitzgerald fan ... wasn't he the one who said&nbsp;</p>
<p>you shouldn't trust anybody who calls himself an ordinary man? You&nbsp;</p>
<p>lent me the book!" said Naoko with a mischievous smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"True," I said. "But this is no affectation. I really, truly believe deep&nbsp;</p>
<p>down that I'm an ordinary person. Can you find something in me that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>not ordinary?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I can!" said Naoko with a hint of impatience. "Don't you&nbsp;</p>
<p>get it? Why do you think I slept with you? Because I was so drunk I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would have slept with anyone?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, of course I don't think that," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>134&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko remained silent for a long time, staring at her toes. At a loss for&nbsp;</p>
<p>words, I took another sip of wine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How many girls have you slept with, Toru?" Naoko asked in a tiny&nbsp;</p>
<p>voice as if the thought had just crossed her mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Eight or nine," I answered truthfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko plopped the guitar into her lap. "You're not even 20 years old!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said. "What kind of life are you leading?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko kept silent and watched me with those clear eyes of hers. I told&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko about the first girl I'd slept with and how we had broken up. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had found it impossible to love her, I explained. I went on to tell her&nbsp;</p>
<p>about my sleeping with one girl after another under Nagasawa's&nbsp;</p>
<p>tutelage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to make excuses, but I was in pain," I said to Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Here I was, seeing you almost every week, and talking with you, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>knowing that the only one in your heart was Kizuki. It hurt. It really&nbsp;</p>
<p>hurt. And I think that's why I slept with girls I didn't know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko shook her head for a few moments, and then she raised her face&nbsp;</p>
<p>to look at me. "You asked me that time why I had never slept with&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki, didn't you? Do you still want to know?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose it's something I really ought to know," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think so, too," said Naoko. "The dead will always be dead, but we&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to go on living."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded. Reiko played the same difficult passage over and over,&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to get it right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was ready to sleep with him," said Naoko, unclasping her hairslide&nbsp;</p>
<p>and letting her hair down. She toyed with the butterfly shape in her&nbsp;</p>
<p>hands. "And of course he wanted to sleep with me. So we tried. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried a lot. But it never worked. We couldn't do it. I didn't know why&nbsp;</p>
<p>then, and I still don't know why. I loved him, and I wasn't worried&nbsp;</p>
<p>about losing my virginity. I would have been glad to do anything he&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted. But it never worked."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko lifted the hair she had let down and fastened it with the slide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>135&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I couldn't get wet," she said in a tiny voice. "I never opened to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it always hurt. I was just too dry, it hurt too much. We tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything we could think of - creams and things - but still it hurt me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I used my fingers, or my lips. I would always do it for him that&nbsp;</p>
<p>way. You know what I mean."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded in silence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko cast her gaze through the window at the moon, which looked&nbsp;</p>
<p>bigger and brighter now than it had before. "I never wanted to talk&nbsp;</p>
<p>about any of this," she said. "I wanted to shut it up in my heart. I wish&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still could. But I have to talk about it. I don't know the answer. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>mean, I was plenty wet the time I slept with you, wasn't I?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-huh," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was wet from the minute you walked into my flat the night of my&nbsp;</p>
<p>twentieth birthday. I wanted you to hold me. I wanted you to take off&nbsp;</p>
<p>my clothes, to touch me all over and enter me. I had never felt like&nbsp;</p>
<p>that before. Why is that? Why do things happen like that? I mean, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>really loved him."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And not me," I said. "You want to know why you felt that way about&nbsp;</p>
<p>me, even though you didn't love me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," said Naoko. "I don't mean to hurt you, but this much you&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to understand: Kizuki and I had a truly special relationship. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been together from the time we were three. It's how we grew up:&nbsp;</p>
<p>always together, always talking, understanding each other perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time we kissed it was in the first year of junior school - was&nbsp;</p>
<p>just wonderful. The first time I had my period, I ran to him and cried&nbsp;</p>
<p>like a baby. We were that close. So after he died, I didn't know how to&nbsp;</p>
<p>relate to other people. I didn't know what it meant to love another&nbsp;</p>
<p>person."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She reached for her wineglass on the table but only managed to knock&nbsp;</p>
<p>it over, spilling wine on the carpet. I crouched down and retrieved the&nbsp;</p>
<p>glass, setting it on the table. Did she want to drink some more? I&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked. Naoko remained silent for a while, then suddenly burst into&nbsp;</p>
<p>136&nbsp;</p>
<p>tears, trembling all over. Slumping forward, she buried her face in her&nbsp;</p>
<p>hands and sobbed with the same suffocating violence as she had that&nbsp;</p>
<p>night with me. Reiko laid down her guitar and sat by Naoko, caressing&nbsp;</p>
<p>her back. When she put an arm across Naoko's shoulders, she pressed&nbsp;</p>
<p>her face against Reiko's chest like a baby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know," Reiko said to me, "it might be a good idea for you to go&nbsp;</p>
<p>out for a little walk. Maybe 20 minutes. Sorry, but I think that would&nbsp;</p>
<p>help."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded and stood, pulling a jumper on over my shirt. "Thanks for&nbsp;</p>
<p>stepping in," I said to Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't mention it," she said with a wink. "This is not your fault. Don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>worry, by the time you come back she'll be OK."&nbsp;</p>
<p>My feet carried me down the road, which was illuminated by the&nbsp;</p>
<p>oddly unreal light of the moon, and into the woods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beneath that moonlight, all sounds bore a strange reverberation. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>hollow sound of my own footsteps seemed to come from another&nbsp;</p>
<p>direction as though I were hearing someone walking on the bottom of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sea. Behind me, every now and then, I would hear a crack or a&nbsp;</p>
<p>rustle. A heavy pall hung over the forest, as if the animals of the night&nbsp;</p>
<p>were holding their breath, waiting for me to pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where the road sloped upwards beyond the trees, I sat and looked&nbsp;</p>
<p>towards the building where Naoko lived. It was easy to tell her room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I had to do was find the one window towards the back where a&nbsp;</p>
<p>faint light trembled. I focused on that point of light for a long, long&nbsp;</p>
<p>time. It made me think of something like the final pulse of a soul's&nbsp;</p>
<p>dying embers. I wanted to cup my hands over what was left and keep&nbsp;</p>
<p>it alive. I went on watching it the way Jay Gatsby watched that tiny&nbsp;</p>
<p>light on the opposite shore night after night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I walked back to the front entrance of the building half an hour&nbsp;</p>
<p>later, I could hear Reiko practising the guitar. I padded up the stairs&nbsp;</p>
<p>and tapped on the door to the flat. Inside there was no sign of Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>137&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko sat alone on the carpet, playing her guitar. She pointed towards&nbsp;</p>
<p>the bedroom door to let me know Naoko was in there. Then she set&nbsp;</p>
<p>down the guitar on the floor and took a seat on the sofa, inviting me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>sit next to her and dividing what wine was left between our two&nbsp;</p>
<p>glasses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Naoko is fine," she said, touching my knee. "Don't worry, all she has&nbsp;</p>
<p>to do is rest for a while. She'll calm down. She was just a little worked&nbsp;</p>
<p>up. How about taking a walk with me in the meantime?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko and I ambled down a road illuminated by street lamps. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>we reached the area by the tennis and basketball courts, we sat on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>bench. She picked up a basketball from under the bench and turned it&nbsp;</p>
<p>in her hands. Then she asked me if I played tennis. I knew how to&nbsp;</p>
<p>play, I said, but I was bad at it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about basketball?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not my strongest sport," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What is your strongest sport?" Reiko asked, wrinkling the corners of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her eyes with a smile. "Aside from sleeping with girls."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not so good at that, either," I said, stung by her words. "Just&nbsp;</p>
<p>kidding," she said. "Don't get angry. But really, though, what are you&nbsp;</p>
<p>good at?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing special. I have things I like to do." "For instance?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hiking. Swimming. Reading."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You like to do things alone, then?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess so. I could never get excited about games you play with other&nbsp;</p>
<p>people. I can't get into them. I lose interest."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then you have to come here in the winter. We do crosscountry&nbsp;</p>
<p>skiing. I'm sure you'd like that, tramping around in the snow all day,&nbsp;</p>
<p>working up a good sweat." Under the street lamp, Reiko stared at her&nbsp;</p>
<p>right hand as though she were inspecting an antique musical&nbsp;</p>
<p>instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does Naoko often get like that?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>138&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every now and then," said Reiko, now looking at her left hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every once in a while she'll get worked up and cry like that. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>that's OK. She's letting out her feelings. The scary thing is not being&nbsp;</p>
<p>able to do that. When your feelings build up and harden and die&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside, then you're in big trouble."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Did I say something I shouldn't have?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not a thing. Don't worry. Just speak your mind honestly That's the&nbsp;</p>
<p>best thing. It may hurt a little sometimes, and someone may get upset&nbsp;</p>
<p>the way Naoko did, but in the long run it's for the best. That's what&nbsp;</p>
<p>you should do if you're serious about making Naoko well again. Like I&nbsp;</p>
<p>told you in the beginning, you should think not so much about&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanting to help her as wanting to recover yourself by helping her to&nbsp;</p>
<p>recover. That's the way it's done here. So you have to be honest and&nbsp;</p>
<p>say everything that comes to mind, while you're here at least. Nobody&nbsp;</p>
<p>does that in the outside world, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess not," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've seen all kinds of people come and go in my time here," she said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"maybe too many people. So I can usually tell by looking at a person&nbsp;</p>
<p>whether they're going to get better or not, almost by instinct. But in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko's case, I'm not sure. I have absolutely no idea what's going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>happen to her. For all I know, she could be 100 per cent recovered&nbsp;</p>
<p>next month, or she could go on like this for years. So I really can't tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>you what to do aside from the most generalized kind of advice: to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>honest and help each other."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What makes Naoko such a hard case for you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Probably because I like her so much. I think my emotions get in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>way and I can't see her clearly. I mean, I really like her. But aside&nbsp;</p>
<p>from that, she has a bundle of different problems that are all tangled&nbsp;</p>
<p>up with each other so that it's hard to unravel a single one. It may take&nbsp;</p>
<p>a very long time to undo them all, or something could trigger them to&nbsp;</p>
<p>come unravelled all at once. It's kind of like that. Which is why I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>be sure about her."&nbsp;</p>
<p>139&nbsp;</p>
<p>She picked up the basketball again, twirled it in her hands and&nbsp;</p>
<p>bounced it on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The most important thing is not to let yourself get impatient," Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don't get&nbsp;</p>
<p>impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can't do anything, don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread&nbsp;</p>
<p>before it's ready to come undone. You have to realize it's going to be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>long process and that you'll work on things slowly, one at a time. Do&nbsp;</p>
<p>you think you can do that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can try," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It may take a very long time, you know, and even then she may not&nbsp;</p>
<p>recover completely. Have you thought about that?" I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Waiting is hard," she said, bouncing the ball. "Especially for&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone your age. You just sit and wait for her to get better. Without&nbsp;</p>
<p>deadlines or guarantees. Do you think you can do that? Do you love&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko that much?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not sure," I said honestly. "Like Naoko, I'm not really sure what it&nbsp;</p>
<p>means to love another person. Though she meant it a little differently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do want to try my best, though. I have to, or else I won't know where&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go. Like you said before, Naoko and I have to save each other. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only way for either of us to be saved."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And are you going to go on sleeping with girls you pick up?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know what to do about that either," I said. "What do you&nbsp;</p>
<p>think? Should I just keep waiting and masturbating? I'm not in&nbsp;</p>
<p>complete control there, either."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko set the ball on the ground and patted my knee. "Look," she said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not telling you to stop sleeping with girls. If you're OK with that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>then it's OK. It's your life after all, it's something you have to decide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I'm saying is you shouldn't use yourself up in some unnatural&nbsp;</p>
<p>form. Do you see what I'm getting at? It would be such a waste. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>years 19 and 20 are a crucial stage in the maturation of character, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you allow yourself to become warped when you're that&nbsp;</p>
<p>140&nbsp;</p>
<p>age, it will cause you pain when you're older. It's true. So think about&nbsp;</p>
<p>it carefully. If you want to take care of Naoko, take care of yourself,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I would think about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was 20 myself. Once upon a time. Would you believe it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I believe it. Of course."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Deep down?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Deep down," I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I was cute, too. Not as cute as Naoko, but pretty damn cute. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't have all these wrinkles."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I liked her wrinkles a lot. She thanked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But don't ever tell another woman that you find her wrinkles&nbsp;</p>
<p>attractive," she added. "I like to hear it, but I'm the exception."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll be careful," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She slipped a wallet from her trouser pocket and handed me a photo&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the card-holder. It was a colour snapshot of a cute girl around ten&nbsp;</p>
<p>years old wearing skis and a brightly coloured ski-suit, standing on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>snow smiling sweetly for the camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Isn't she pretty? My daughter," said Reiko. "She sent me this in&nbsp;</p>
<p>January. She's - what? - nine years old now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She has your smile," I said, returning the photo. Reiko pocketed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>wallet and, with a sniff, put a cigarette between her lips and lit up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was going to be a concert pianist," she said. "I had talent, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>people recognized it and made a fuss over me while I was growing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won competitions and had top marks in the conservatoire, and I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>all set to study in Germany after graduation. Not a cloud on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>horizon. Everything worked out perfectly, and when it didn't there was&nbsp;</p>
<p>always somebody to fix it. But then one day something happened, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>it all blew apart. I was in my final year at the conservatoire and there&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a fairly important competition coming up. I practised for it&nbsp;</p>
<p>constantly, but all of a sudden the little finger of my left hand stopped&nbsp;</p>
<p>moving. I don't know why, but it just did. I tried massaging it, soaking&nbsp;</p>
<p>141&nbsp;</p>
<p>it in hot water, taking a few days off from practice: nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So then I got scared and went to the doctor's. They tried all kinds of&nbsp;</p>
<p>tests but they couldn't come up with anything. There was nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrong with the finger itself, and the nerves were OK, they said: there&nbsp;</p>
<p>was no reason it should stop moving. The problem must be&nbsp;</p>
<p>psychological. So I went to a psychiatrist, but he didn't really know&nbsp;</p>
<p>what was going on, either. Probably pre-competition stress, he said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and advised me to get away from the piano for a while."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko inhaled deeply and let the smoke out. Then she bent her neck to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the side a few times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So I went to recuperate at my grandmother's place on the coast in Izu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I'd forget about that particular competition and really relax,&nbsp;</p>
<p>spend a couple of weeks away from the piano doing anything I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted. But it was hopeless. Piano was all I could think about. Maybe&nbsp;</p>
<p>my finger would never move again. How would I live if that&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened? The same thoughts kept going round and round in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>brain. And no wonder: piano had been my whole life up to that point. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had started playing when I was four and grew up thinking about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>piano and nothing else. I never did housework so as not to injure my&nbsp;</p>
<p>fingers. People paid attention to me for that one thing: my talent at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>piano. Take the piano away from a girl who's grown up like that, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>what's left? So then, snap! MY mind became a complete jumble. Total&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She dropped her cigarette to the ground and stamped it out, then bent&nbsp;</p>
<p>her neck a few times again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That was the end of my dream of becoming a concert pianist. I spent&nbsp;</p>
<p>two months in the hospital. My finger started to move shortly after I&nbsp;</p>
<p>arrived, so I was able to return to the conservatoire and graduate, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>something inside me had vanished. Some jewel of energy or&nbsp;</p>
<p>something had disappeared - evaporated - from inside my body. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>doctor said I lacked the mental strength to become a professional&nbsp;</p>
<p>pianist and advised me to abandon the idea. So after graduating I took&nbsp;</p>
<p>142&nbsp;</p>
<p>pupils and taught them at home. But the pain I felt was excruciating. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was as if my life had ended. Here I was in my early twenties and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>best part of my life was over. Do you see how terrible that would be? I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had such potential, then woke up one day and it had gone. No more&nbsp;</p>
<p>applause, no one would make a big fuss over me, no one would tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>me how wonderful I was. I spent day after day in the house teaching&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbourhood children Beyer exercises and sonatinas. I felt so&nbsp;</p>
<p>miserable, I cried all the time. To think what I had missed! I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>hear about people who were far less talented than me winning second&nbsp;</p>
<p>place in a competition or holding a recital in such-and-such a hall, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the tears would pour out of me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My parents walked around on tiptoe, afraid of hurting me. But I&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew how disappointed they were. All of a sudden the daughter they&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been so proud of was an ex-mental-patient. They couldn't even&nbsp;</p>
<p>marry me off. When you're living with people, you sense what they're&nbsp;</p>
<p>feeling, and I hated it. I was afraid to go out, afraid the neighbours&nbsp;</p>
<p>were talking about me. So then, snap! It happened again - the jumble,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the darkness. It happened when I was 24, and this time I spent seven&nbsp;</p>
<p>months in a sanatorium. Not this place: a regular insane asylum with&nbsp;</p>
<p>high walls and locked gates. A filthy place without pianos. I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>know what to do with myself. All I knew was I wanted to get out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>there as soon as I could, so I struggled desperately to get better. Seven&nbsp;</p>
<p>months: a long seven months. That's when my wrinkles started."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko smiled, her lips stretching from side to side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hadn't been out of the hospital for long when I met a man and got&nbsp;</p>
<p>married. He was a year younger than me, an engineer who worked in&nbsp;</p>
<p>an aeroplane manufacturing company, and one of my pupils. A nice&nbsp;</p>
<p>man. He didn't say a lot, but he was warm and sincere. He had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>taking lessons from me for six months when all of a sudden he asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>me to marry him. Just like that - one day when we were having tea&nbsp;</p>
<p>after his lesson. Can you believe it? We had never dated or held&nbsp;</p>
<p>hands. He took me totally off guard. I told him I couldn't get married.&nbsp;</p>
<p>143&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I liked him and thought he was a nice person but that, for certain&nbsp;</p>
<p>reasons, I couldn't marry him. He wanted to know what those reasons&nbsp;</p>
<p>were, so I explained everything to him with complete honesty - that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been hospitalized twice for mental breakdowns. I told him&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything - what the cause had been, my condition, and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>possibility that it could happen again. He said he needed time to think,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I encouraged him to take all the time he needed. But when he&nbsp;</p>
<p>came for his lesson a week later, he said he still wanted to marry me. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked him to wait three months. We would see each other for three&nbsp;</p>
<p>months, I said, and if he still wanted to marry me at that point, we&nbsp;</p>
<p>would talk about it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We dated once a week for three months. We went everywhere, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>talked about everything, and I got to like him a lot. When I was with&nbsp;</p>
<p>him, I felt as if my life had finally come back to me. It gave me a&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful sense of relief to be alone with him: I could forget all those&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible things that had happened. So what if I hadn't been able to&nbsp;</p>
<p>become a concert pianist? So what if I had spent time in mental&nbsp;</p>
<p>hospitals? My life hadn't ended. Life was still full of wonderful things&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hadn't experienced. If only for having made me feel that way, I felt&nbsp;</p>
<p>tremendously grateful to him. After three months went by, he asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>me again to marry him. And this is what I said to him: "If you want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleep with me, I don't mind. I've never slept with anybody, and I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>very fond of you, so if you want to make love to me, I don't mind at&nbsp;</p>
<p>all. But marrying me is a whole different matter. If you marry me, you&nbsp;</p>
<p>take on all my troubles, and they're a lot worse than you can imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He said he didn't care, that he didn't just want to sleep with me, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to marry me, to share everything I had inside me. And he&nbsp;</p>
<p>meant it. He was the kind of person who would only say what he&nbsp;</p>
<p>really meant, and do anything he said. So I agreed to marry him. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was all I could do. We got married, let's see, four months later I think&nbsp;</p>
<p>it was. He fought with his parents over me, and they disowned him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was from an old family that lived in a rural part of Shikoku. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>144&nbsp;</p>
<p>had my background investigated and found out that I had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>hospitalized twice. No wonder they opposed the marriage. So,&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyway, we didn't have a wedding ceremony. We just went to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>registry office and registered our marriage and took a trip to Hakone&nbsp;</p>
<p>for two nights. That was plenty for us: we were happy. And finally, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>remained a virgin until the day I married. I was 25 years old! Can you&nbsp;</p>
<p>believe it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko sighed and picked up the basketball again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I thought that as long as I was with him, I would be all right," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>went on. "As long as I was with him, my troubles would stay away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the most important thing for a sickness like ours: a sense of&nbsp;</p>
<p>trust. If I put myself in this person's hands, I'll be OK. If my condition&nbsp;</p>
<p>starts to worsen even the slightest bit - if a screw comes loose - he'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>notice straight away, and with tremendous care and patience he'll fix&nbsp;</p>
<p>it, he'll tighten the screw again, put all the jumbled threads back in&nbsp;</p>
<p>place. If we have that sense of trust, our sickness stays away. No more&nbsp;</p>
<p>snap! I was so happy! Life was great! I felt as if someone had pulled&nbsp;</p>
<p>me out of a cold, raging sea and wrapped me in a blanket and laid me&nbsp;</p>
<p>in a warm bed. I had a baby two years after we were married, and then&nbsp;</p>
<p>my hands were really full! I practically forgot about my sickness. I'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>get up in the morning and do the housework and take care of the baby&nbsp;</p>
<p>and feed my husband when he came home from work. It was the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing day after day, but I was happy. It was probably the happiest time&nbsp;</p>
<p>of my life. How many years did it last, I wonder? At least until I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>31. And then, all of a sudden, snap! It happened again. I fell apart."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko lit a cigarette. The wind had died down. The smoke rose&nbsp;</p>
<p>straight up and disappeared into the darkness of night. Just then I&nbsp;</p>
<p>realized that the sky was filled with stars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Something happened?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "something very strange, as if a trap had been laid for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. Even now, it gives me a chill just to think about it." Reiko rubbed&nbsp;</p>
<p>a temple with her free hand. "I'm sorry, though, making you listen to&nbsp;</p>
<p>145&nbsp;</p>
<p>all this talk about me. You came here to see Naoko, not listen to my&nbsp;</p>
<p>story."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd really like to hear it, though," I said. "If you don't mind, I'd like to&nbsp;</p>
<p>hear the rest."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well," Reiko began, "when our daughter entered kindergarten, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>started playing again, little by little. Not for anyone else, but for&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself. I started with short pieces by Bach, Mozart, Scarlatti. After&nbsp;</p>
<p>such a long blank period, of course, my feel for the music didn't come&nbsp;</p>
<p>back straight away. And my fingers wouldn't move the way they used&nbsp;</p>
<p>to. But I was thrilled to be playing the piano again. With my hands on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the keys, I realized how much I had loved music - and how much I&nbsp;</p>
<p>hungered for it. To be able to perform music for yourself is a&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As I said before, I had been playing from the time I was four years&nbsp;</p>
<p>old, but it occurred to me that I had never once played for myself. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had always been trying to pass a test or practise an assignment or&nbsp;</p>
<p>impress somebody. Those are all important things, of course, if you&nbsp;</p>
<p>are going to master an instrument. But after a certain age you have to&nbsp;</p>
<p>start performing for yourself. That's what music is. I had to drop out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the elite course and pass my thirty-first birthday before I was finally&nbsp;</p>
<p>able to see that. I would send my child off to kindergarten and hurry&nbsp;</p>
<p>through the housework, then spend an hour or two playing music I&nbsp;</p>
<p>liked. So far so good, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then one day I had a visit from one of the ladies of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbourhood, someone I at least knew well enough to say hello to&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the street, asking me to give her daughter piano lessons. I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>know the daughter - although we lived in the same general&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbourhood our houses were still pretty far apart - but according to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the woman, her daughter used to pass my house and loved to hear me&nbsp;</p>
<p>play. She had seen me at some point, too, and now she was pestering&nbsp;</p>
<p>her mother to let me teach her. She was in her fourth year of school&nbsp;</p>
<p>146&nbsp;</p>
<p>and had taken lessons from a number of people but things had not&nbsp;</p>
<p>gone well for one reason or another and now she had no teacher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I turned her down. I had had that blank of several years, and while it&nbsp;</p>
<p>might have made sense for me to take on an absolute beginner, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>would have been impossible for me to pick up with someone who had&nbsp;</p>
<p>had lessons for a number of years. Besides, I was too busy taking care&nbsp;</p>
<p>of my own child and, though I didn't say this to the woman, nobody&nbsp;</p>
<p>can deal with the kind of child who changes teachers constantly. So&nbsp;</p>
<p>then the woman asked me to at least do her daughter the favour of&nbsp;</p>
<p>meeting her once. She was a fairly pushy lady and I could see she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>not going to let me off the hook that easily, so I agreed to meet the girl - but just meet her. Three days later the girl came to the house by&nbsp;</p>
<p>herself. She was an absolute angel, with a kind of pure, sweet,&nbsp;</p>
<p>transparent beauty. I had never - and have never - seen such a&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful little girl. She had long, shiny hair as black as freshly ground&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indian ink, slim, graceful arms and legs, bright eyes, and a soft little&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth that looked as if someone had just made it. I couldn't speak&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I first saw her, she was so beautiful. Sitting on my sofa, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned my living room into a gorgeous parlour. It hurt to look directly&nbsp;</p>
<p>at her: I had to squint. So, anyway, that's what she was like. I can still&nbsp;</p>
<p>picture her clearly."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko narrowed her eyes as if she were actually picturing the girl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Over coffee we talked for a whole hour - talked about all kinds of&nbsp;</p>
<p>things: music, her school, just everything. I could see straight away&nbsp;</p>
<p>she was a smart one. She knew how to hold a conversation: she had&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear, shrewd opinions and a natural gift for drawing out the other&nbsp;</p>
<p>person. It was almost frightening. Exactly what it was that made her&nbsp;</p>
<p>frightening, I couldn't tell at the time. It just struck me how&nbsp;</p>
<p>frighteningly intelligent she was. But in her presence I lost any normal&nbsp;</p>
<p>powers of judgement I might have had. She was so young and&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful, I felt overwhelmed to the point where I saw myself as an&nbsp;</p>
<p>inferior specimen, a clumsy excuse for a human being who could only&nbsp;</p>
<p>147&nbsp;</p>
<p>have negative thoughts about her because of my own warped and&nbsp;</p>
<p>filthy mind."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko shook her head several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If I were as pretty and smart as she was, I'd have been&nbsp;</p>
<p>a normal human being. What more could you want if you were that&nbsp;</p>
<p>smart and that beautiful? Why would you have to torment and walk all&nbsp;</p>
<p>over your weaker inferiors if everybody loved you so much? What&nbsp;</p>
<p>reason could there possibly be for acting that way?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Did she do something terrible to you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, let me just say the girl was a pathological liar. She was sick,&nbsp;</p>
<p>pure and simple. She made up everything. And while she was making&nbsp;</p>
<p>up her stories, she would come to believe them. And then she would&nbsp;</p>
<p>change things around her to fit her story. She had such a quick mind,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she could always keep a step ahead of you and take care of things that&nbsp;</p>
<p>would ordinarily strike you as odd, so it would never cross your mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>she was lying. First of all, no one would ever suspect that such a pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>little girl would lie about the most ordinary things. I certainly didn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She told me tons of lies for six months before I had the slightest&nbsp;</p>
<p>inkling anything was wrong. She lied about everything, and I never&nbsp;</p>
<p>suspected. I know it sounds crazy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What did she lie about?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I say everything, I mean everything." Reiko gave a sarcastic&nbsp;</p>
<p>laugh. "When people tell a lie about something, they have to make up&nbsp;</p>
<p>a bunch of lies to go with the first one. 'Mythomania' is the word for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the usual mythomaniac tells lies, they're usually the innocent&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind, and most people notice. But not with that girl. To protect herself,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she'd tell hurtful lies without batting an eyelid. She'd use everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>she could get her hands on. And she would lie either more or less&nbsp;</p>
<p>depending on who she was talking to. To her mother or close friends&nbsp;</p>
<p>who would know straight away, she hardly ever lied, or if she had to&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell one, she'd be really, really careful to tell lies that wouldn't come&nbsp;</p>
<p>out. Or if they did come out, she'd find an excuse or apologize in that&nbsp;</p>
<p>148&nbsp;</p>
<p>clingy voice of hers with tears pouring out of her beautiful eyes. No&nbsp;</p>
<p>one could stay mad at her then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I still don't know why she chose me. Was I another victim to her, or a&nbsp;</p>
<p>source of salvation? I just don't know. Of course, it hardly matters&nbsp;</p>
<p>now. Now that everything is over. Now that I'm like this."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A short silence followed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She repeated what her mother had told me, that she had been moved&nbsp;</p>
<p>when she heard me playing as she passed the house. She had seen me&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the street a few times, too, and had begun to worship me. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>actually used that word: "worship'. It made me turn bright red. I mean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be "worshipped' by such a beautiful little doll of a girl! I don't think&nbsp;</p>
<p>it was an absolute lie, though. I was in my thirties already, of course,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I could never be as beautiful and bright as she was, and I had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>special talent, but I must have had something that drew her to me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>something that was missing in her, I suppose. That must have been&nbsp;</p>
<p>what got her interested in me to begin with. I believe that now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>looking back. And I'm not boasting."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I think I know what you mean."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She had brought some music with her and asked if she could play for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. So I let her. It was a Bach invention. Her performance was ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>interesting. Or should I say strange? It just wasn't ordinary. Of course&nbsp;</p>
<p>it wasn't polished. She hadn't been going to a professional school, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>what lessons she had taken had been an on-and-off kind of thing; she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was very much self-taught. Her sound was untrained. She'd have been&nbsp;</p>
<p>rejected immediately at a music-school audition. But she made it&nbsp;</p>
<p>work. Although 90 per cent was just terrible, the other 10 per cent was&nbsp;</p>
<p>there: she made it sing: it was music. And this was a Bach invention!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I got interested in her. I wanted to know what she was all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Needless to say, the world is full of kids who can play Bach far better&nbsp;</p>
<p>than she could. Twenty times better. But most of their performances&nbsp;</p>
<p>would have nothing to them. They'd be hollow, empty. This girl's&nbsp;</p>
<p>technique was bad, but she had that little bit of something that could&nbsp;</p>
<p>149&nbsp;</p>
<p>draw people - or draw me, at least - into her performance. So I decided&nbsp;</p>
<p>it might be worthwhile to teach her. Of course, retraining her at that&nbsp;</p>
<p>point to where she could become a pro was out of the question. But I&nbsp;</p>
<p>felt it might be possible to make her into the kind of happy pianist I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was then - and still am - someone who could enjoy making music for&nbsp;</p>
<p>herself. This turned out to be an empty hope, though. She was not the&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind of person who quietly goes about doing things for herself. This&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a child who would make detailed calculations to use every means&nbsp;</p>
<p>at her disposal to impress other people. She knew exactly what she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to do to make people admire and praise her. And she knew exactly&nbsp;</p>
<p>what kind of performance it would take to draw me in. She had&nbsp;</p>
<p>calculated everything, I'm sure, and put everything she had into&nbsp;</p>
<p>practising the most important passages over and over again for my&nbsp;</p>
<p>benefit. I can see her doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Still, even now, after all of this came clear to me, I believe it was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful performance and I would feel the same chills down my&nbsp;</p>
<p>spine if I could hear it again. Knowing all I know about her flaws, her&nbsp;</p>
<p>cunning and lies, I would still feel it. I'm telling you, there are such&nbsp;</p>
<p>things in this world."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko cleared her throat with a dry rasp and broke off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, did you take her as a pupil?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. One lesson a week. Saturday mornings. Saturday was a day off&nbsp;</p>
<p>at her school. She never missed a lesson, she was never late, she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>an ideal pupil. She always practised for her lessons. After every&nbsp;</p>
<p>lesson, we'd have some cake and chat."&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point, Reiko looked at her watch as if suddenly remembering&nbsp;</p>
<p>something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't you think we should be getting back to the room? I'm a little&nbsp;</p>
<p>worried about Naoko. I'm sure you haven't forgotten about her now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>have you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course not," I laughed. "It's just that I was drawn into your story."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you'd like to hear the rest, I'll tell it to you tomorrow. It's a long&nbsp;</p>
<p>150&nbsp;</p>
<p>story - too long for one sitting." "You're a regular Scheherazade."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know," she said, joining her laughter with mine. "You'll never get&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to Tokyo."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We retraced our steps through the path in the woods and returned to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the flat. The candles had been extinguished and the living room lights&nbsp;</p>
<p>were out. The bedroom door was open and the lamp on the night table&nbsp;</p>
<p>was on, its pale light spilling into the living room. Naoko sat alone on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sofa in the gloom. She had changed into a loose-fitting blue gown,&nbsp;</p>
<p>its collar pulled tight about her neck, her legs folded under her on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sofa. Reiko approached her and rested a hand on her crown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you all right now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Sorry," answered Naoko in a tiny voice. Then she turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>towards me and repeated her apology. "I must have scared you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A little," I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come here," she said. When I sat down next to her, Naoko, her legs&nbsp;</p>
<p>still folded, leaned towards me until her face was nearly touching my&nbsp;</p>
<p>ear, as though she were about to share a secret with me. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>planted a soft kiss by my ear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said once more, this time directly into my ear, her voice&nbsp;</p>
<p>subdued. Then she moved away from me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sometimes," she said, "I get so confused, I don't know what's&nbsp;</p>
<p>happening."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That happens to me all the time," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko smiled and looked at me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you don't mind," I said, "I'd like to hear more about you. About&nbsp;</p>
<p>your life here. What you do every day. The people you meet."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko talked about her daily routine in this place, speaking in short&nbsp;</p>
<p>but crystal clear phrases. Wake up at six in the morning. Breakfast in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the flat. Clean out the aviary. Then usually farm work. She took care&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the vegetables. Before or after lunch, she would have either an&nbsp;</p>
<p>hour-long session with her doctor or a group discussion. In the&nbsp;</p>
<p>afternoon she could choose from among courses that might interest&nbsp;</p>
<p>151&nbsp;</p>
<p>her, outside work, or sports. She had taken several courses: French,&nbsp;</p>
<p>knitting, piano, ancient history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Reiko is teaching me piano," she said. "She also teaches guitar. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>all take turns as pupils or teachers. Somebody with fluent French&nbsp;</p>
<p>teaches French, one person who used to be in social studies teaches&nbsp;</p>
<p>history, another good at knitting teaches knitting: that's a pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>impressive school right there. Unfortunately, I don't have anything I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can teach anyone."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Neither do I," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I put a lot more energy into my studies here than I ever did in&nbsp;</p>
<p>university. I work hard and enjoy it - a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you do after supper?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Talk with Reiko, read, listen to records, go to other people's flats and&nbsp;</p>
<p>play games, stuff like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do guitar practice and write my autobiography," said Reiko.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Autobiography?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just kidding," Reiko laughed. "We go to bed around ten. Pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>healthy lifestyle, wouldn't you say? We sleep like babies."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. It was a few minutes before nine. "I guess you'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>be getting sleepy soon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK. We can stay up late today," said Naoko. "I haven't seen&nbsp;</p>
<p>you in such a long time, I want to talk more. So talk."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I was alone before, all of a sudden I started thinking about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>old days," I said. "Do you remember when Kizuki and I came to visit&nbsp;</p>
<p>you at the hospital? The one on the seashore. I think it was the first&nbsp;</p>
<p>year of the sixth-form."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I had the chest operation," Naoko said with a smile. "Sure, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember. You and Kizuki came on a motorbike. You brought me a&nbsp;</p>
<p>box of chocolates and they were all melted together. They were so&nbsp;</p>
<p>hard to eat! I don't know, it seems like such a long time ago."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, really. I think you were writing a poem then, a long one."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All girls write poems at that age," Naoko tittered. "What reminded&nbsp;</p>
<p>152&nbsp;</p>
<p>you of that all of a sudden?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder. The smell of the sea wind, the oleanders: before I knew it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>they just popped into my head. Did Kizuki come to see you at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>hospital a lot?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way! We had a big fight about that afterwards. He came once,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then he came with you, and that was it for him. He was terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that first time he couldn't sit still and he only stayed about ten&nbsp;</p>
<p>minutes. He brought me some oranges and mumbled all this stuff I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't understand, and he peeled an orange for me and mumbled&nbsp;</p>
<p>more stuff and he was out of there. He said he had a thing about&nbsp;</p>
<p>hospitals."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko laughed. "He was always a kid about that kind of stuff. I mean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>nobody likes hospitals, right? That's why people visit people in&nbsp;</p>
<p>hospitals to make them feel better, and perk up their spirits and stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Kizuki just didn't get it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He wasn't so bad when the two of us came to see you, though. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>was just his usual self."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because you were there," said Naoko. "He was always like that&nbsp;</p>
<p>around you. He struggled to keep his weaknesses hidden. I'm sure he&nbsp;</p>
<p>was very fond of you. He made a point of letting you see only his best&nbsp;</p>
<p>side. He wasn't like that with me. He'd let his guard down. He could&nbsp;</p>
<p>be really moody. One minute he'd be chattering away, and the next&nbsp;</p>
<p>he'd be depressed. It happened all the time. He was like that from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>time he was little. He did keep trying to change himself, to improve&nbsp;</p>
<p>himself, though."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko re-crossed her legs on the sofa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He tried hard, but it didn't do any good, and that would make him&nbsp;</p>
<p>really angry and sad. There was so much about him that was fine and&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful, but he could never find the confidence he needed. "I've got&nbsp;</p>
<p>to do that, I've got to change this,' he was always thinking, right up to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the end. Poor Kizuki!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Still," I said, "if it's true that he was always struggling to show me his&nbsp;</p>
<p>153&nbsp;</p>
<p>best side, I'd say he succeeded. His best side was all that I could see."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko smiled. "He'd be thrilled if he could hear you say that. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>were his only friend."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And Kizuki was my only friend," I said. "There was never anybody I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could really call a friend, before him or after him."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's why I loved being with the two of you. His best side was all&nbsp;</p>
<p>that I could see then, too. I could relax and stop worrying when the&nbsp;</p>
<p>three of us were together. Those were my favourite times. I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>know how you felt about it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I used to worry about what you were thinking," I said, giving my&nbsp;</p>
<p>head a shake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The problem was that that kind of thing couldn't go on for ever," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko. "Such perfect little circles are impossible to maintain. Kizuki&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew it, and I knew it, and so did you. Am I right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, though," Naoko went on, "I loved his weak side,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too. I loved it as much as I loved his good side. There was absolutely&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing mean or underhand about him. He was weak: that's all. I tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>to tell him that, but he wouldn't believe me. He'd always tell me it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>because we had been together since we were three. I knew him too&nbsp;</p>
<p>well, he'd say: I couldn't tell the difference between his strong points&nbsp;</p>
<p>and his flaws, they were all the same to me. He couldn't change my&nbsp;</p>
<p>mind about him, though. I went on loving him just the same, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could never be interested in anyone else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko looked at me with a sad smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Our boy-girl relationship was really unusual, too. It was as if we&nbsp;</p>
<p>were physically joined somewhere. If we happened to be apart, some&nbsp;</p>
<p>special gravitational force would pull us back together again. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>the most natural thing in the world when we became boyfriend and&nbsp;</p>
<p>girlfriend. It was nothing we had to think about or make any choices&nbsp;</p>
<p>about. We started kissing at 12 and petting at 13. I'd go to his room or&nbsp;</p>
<p>154&nbsp;</p>
<p>he'd come to my room and I'd finish him off with my hands. It never&nbsp;</p>
<p>occurred to me that we were being precocious. It just happened as a&nbsp;</p>
<p>matter of course. If he wanted to play with my breasts or pussy, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't mind at all, or if he had cum he wanted to get rid of, I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>mind helping him with that, either. I'm sure it would have shocked us&nbsp;</p>
<p>both if someone had accused us of doing anything wrong. Because we&nbsp;</p>
<p>weren't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were just doing what we were supposed to do. We had always&nbsp;</p>
<p>shown each other every part of our bodies. It was almost as if we&nbsp;</p>
<p>owned each other's bodies jointly. For a while, at least, we made sure&nbsp;</p>
<p>we didn't go any further than that, though. We were afraid of my&nbsp;</p>
<p>getting pregnant, and had almost no idea at that point of how to go&nbsp;</p>
<p>about preventing it ... Anyway, that's how Kizuki and I grew up&nbsp;</p>
<p>together, hand in hand, an inseparable pair. We had almost no sense of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the oppressiveness of sex or the anguish that comes with the sudden&nbsp;</p>
<p>swelling of the ego that ordinary kids experience when they reach&nbsp;</p>
<p>puberty. We were totally open about sex, and where our egos were&nbsp;</p>
<p>concerned, the way we absorbed and shared each other's, we had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>strong awareness of them. Do you see what I mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think so," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We couldn't bear to be apart. So if Kizuki had lived, I'm sure we&nbsp;</p>
<p>would have been together, loving each other, and gradually growing&nbsp;</p>
<p>unhappy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Unhappy? Why's that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>With her fingers, Naoko combed her hair back several times. She had&nbsp;</p>
<p>taken her hairslide off, which made the hair fall over her face when&nbsp;</p>
<p>she dropped her head forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because we would have had to pay the world back what we owed it,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said, raising her eyes to mine. "The pain of growing up. We didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>pay when we should have, so now the bills are due. Which is why&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki did what he did, and why I'm here. We were like kids who&nbsp;</p>
<p>grew up naked on a desert island. If we got hungry, we'd just pick a&nbsp;</p>
<p>155&nbsp;</p>
<p>banana; if we got lonely, we'd go to sleep in each other's arms. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>that kind of thing doesn't last for ever. We grew up fast and had to&nbsp;</p>
<p>enter society. Which is why you were so important to us. You were&nbsp;</p>
<p>the link connecting us with the outside. We were struggling through&nbsp;</p>
<p>you to fit in with the outside world as best we could. In the end, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't work, of course."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wouldn't want you to think that we were using you, though. Kizuki&nbsp;</p>
<p>really loved you. It just so happened that our connection with you was&nbsp;</p>
<p>our first connection with anyone else. And it still is. Kizuki may be&nbsp;</p>
<p>dead, but you are still My only link with the outside world. And just as&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki loved you, I love you. We never meant to hurt you, but we&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably did; we probably ended up making a deep wound in your&nbsp;</p>
<p>heart. It never occurred to us that anything like that might happen."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko lowered her head again and fell silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, how about a cup of cocoa?" suggested Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good. I'd really like some," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like to have some of that brandy I brought, if you don't mind," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, absolutely," said Reiko. "Could I have a sip?" "Sure," I said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko brought out two glasses and we toasted each other. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>went into the kitchen to make cocoa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Can we talk about something a little more cheerful?" asked Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have anything cheerful to talk about. I thought, If only Storm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trooper were still around! That guy could inspire a string of stories. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>few of those would have made everybody feel good. The best I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>do was talk at length about the filthy habits of the guys in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dormitory. I felt sick just talking about something so gross, but Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Reiko practically fell over laughing, it was all so new to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next Reiko did imitations of mental patients. This was a lot of fun,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too. Naoko started looking sleepy after eleven o'clock, so Reiko let&nbsp;</p>
<p>156&nbsp;</p>
<p>down the sofa back and handed me a pillow, sheets and blankets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you feel like raping anybody in the middle of the night, don't get&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wrong one," she said. "The unwrinkled body in the left bed is&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko's."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Liar! Mine's the right bed," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko added, "By the way, I arranged for us to skip some of our&nbsp;</p>
<p>afternoon schedule. Why don't the three of us have a little picnic? I&nbsp;</p>
<p>know a really nice place close by."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good idea," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The women took turns brushing their teeth and withdrew to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>bedroom. I poured myself some brandy and stretched out on the sofa&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed, going over the day's events from morning to night. It felt like an&nbsp;</p>
<p>awfully long day. The room continued to glow white in the moonlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the occasional slight creak of a bed, hardly a sound came&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the bedroom where Naoko and Reiko lay sleeping. Tiny&nbsp;</p>
<p>diagrammatic shapes seemed to float in the darkness when I closed&nbsp;</p>
<p>my eyes, and my ears sensed the lingering reverberation of Reiko's&nbsp;</p>
<p>guitar, but neither of these lasted for long. Sleep came and carried me&nbsp;</p>
<p>into a mass of warm mud. I dreamed of willows. Both sides of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>mountain road were lined with willows. An incredible number of&nbsp;</p>
<p>willows. A fairly stiff breeze was blowing, but the branches of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>willow trees never swayed. Why should that be? I wondered, and then&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw that every branch of every tree had tiny birds clinging to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their weight kept the branches from stirring. I grabbed a stick and hit&nbsp;</p>
<p>a nearby branch with it, hoping to chase away the birds and allow the&nbsp;</p>
<p>branch to sway. But they would not leave. Instead of flying away, they&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned into bird-shaped metal chunks that crashed to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I felt as if I were seeing the continuation of&nbsp;</p>
<p>my dream. The moonlight filled the room with the same soft white&nbsp;</p>
<p>glow. As if by reflex, I sat up in bed and started searching for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>metal birds, which of course were not there. What I saw instead was&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko at the foot of the bed, sitting still and alone, staring out through&nbsp;</p>
<p>157&nbsp;</p>
<p>the window. She had drawn her knees up and was resting her chin on&nbsp;</p>
<p>them, looking like a hungry orphan. I searched for the watch I had left&nbsp;</p>
<p>by my pillow, but it was not in the place where I knew it should be. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>guessed from the angle of the moonlight that the time must be two or&nbsp;</p>
<p>three o'clock in the morning. I felt a violent thirst but I decided to keep&nbsp;</p>
<p>still and continue watching Naoko. She was wearing the same blue&nbsp;</p>
<p>nightdress I had seen her in earlier, and on one side her hair was held&nbsp;</p>
<p>in place by the butterfly hairslide, revealing the beauty of her face in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the moonlight. Strange, I thought, she had taken the slide off before&nbsp;</p>
<p>going to bed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko stayed frozen in place, like a small nocturnal animal that has&nbsp;</p>
<p>been lured out by the moonlight. The direction of the glow&nbsp;</p>
<p>exaggerated the silhouette of her lips. Seeming utterly fragile and&nbsp;</p>
<p>vulnerable, the silhouette pulsed almost imperceptibly with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>beating of her heart or the motions of her inner heart, as if she were&nbsp;</p>
<p>whispering soundless words to the darkness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I swallowed in hopes of easing my thirst, but in the stillness of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>night the sound I made was huge. As if this were a signal to her,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko stood and glided towards the head of the bed, gown rustling&nbsp;</p>
<p>faintly. She knelt on the floor by my pillow, eyes fixed on mine. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>stared back at her, but her eyes told me nothing. Strangely transparent,&nbsp;</p>
<p>they seemed like windows to a world beyond, but however long I&nbsp;</p>
<p>peered into their depths, there was nothing I could see. Our faces were&nbsp;</p>
<p>no more than ten inches apart, but she was light years away from me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reached out and tried to touch her, but Naoko drew back, lips&nbsp;</p>
<p>trembling faintly. A moment later, she brought her hands&nbsp;</p>
<p>up and began slowly to undo the buttons of her gown. There were&nbsp;</p>
<p>seven in all. I felt as if it were the continuation of my dream as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>watched her slim, lovely fingers opening the buttons one by one from&nbsp;</p>
<p>top to bottom. Seven small, white buttons: when she had unfastened&nbsp;</p>
<p>them all, Naoko slipped the gown from her shoulders and threw it off&nbsp;</p>
<p>completely like an insect shedding its skin. She had been wearing&nbsp;</p>
<p>158&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing under the gown. All she had on was the butterfly hairslide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naked now, and still kneeling by the bed, she looked at me. Bathed in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the soft light of the moon, Naoko's body had the heartbreaking lustre&nbsp;</p>
<p>of newborn flesh. When she moved - and she did so almost&nbsp;</p>
<p>imperceptibly - the play of light and shadow on her body shifted&nbsp;</p>
<p>subtly. The swelling roundness of her breasts, her tiny nipples, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>indentation of her navel, her hipbones and pubic hair, all cast grainy&nbsp;</p>
<p>shadows, the shapes of which kept changing like ripples spreading&nbsp;</p>
<p>over the calm surface of a lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What perfect flesh! I thought. When had Naoko come to possess such&nbsp;</p>
<p>a perfect body? What had happened to the body I held in my arms that&nbsp;</p>
<p>night last spring?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sense of imperfection had been what Naoko's body had given me&nbsp;</p>
<p>that night as I tenderly undressed her while she cried. Her breasts had&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed hard, the nipples oddly jutting, the hips strangely rigid. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a beautiful girl, of course, her body marvellous and alluring. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>aroused me that night and swept me along with a gigantic force. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>still, as I held her and caressed her and kissed her naked flesh, I felt a&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange and powerful awareness of the imbalance and awkwardness of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the human body. Holding Naoko in my arms, I wanted to explain to&nbsp;</p>
<p>her, "I am having sex with you now. I am inside you. But really this is&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing. It doesn't matter. It is nothing but the joining of two bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All we are doing is telling each other things that can only be told by&nbsp;</p>
<p>the rubbing together of two imperfect lumps of flesh. By doing this,&nbsp;</p>
<p>we are sharing our imperfection." But of course I could never have&nbsp;</p>
<p>said such a thing with any hope of being understood. I just went on&nbsp;</p>
<p>holding her tightly. And as I did so, I was able to feel inside her body&nbsp;</p>
<p>some kind of stony foreign matter, something extra that I could never&nbsp;</p>
<p>draw close to. And that sensation both filled my heart for Naoko and&nbsp;</p>
<p>gave my erection a terrifying intensity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The body that Naoko revealed before me now, though, was nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>like the one I had held that night. This flesh had been through many&nbsp;</p>
<p>159&nbsp;</p>
<p>changes to be reborn in utter perfection beneath the light of the moon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All signs of girlish plumpness had been stripped away since Kizuki's&nbsp;</p>
<p>death to be replaced by the flesh of a mature woman. So perfect was&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko's physical beauty now that it aroused nothing sexual in me. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could only stare, astounded, at the lovely curve from waist to hips, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>rounded richness of the breasts, the gentle movement with each breath&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the slim belly and the soft, black pubic shadow beneath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She exposed her nakedness to me this way for perhaps five minutes&nbsp;</p>
<p>until, at last, she wrapped herself in her gown once more and buttoned&nbsp;</p>
<p>it from top to bottom. As soon as the final button was in place, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>rose and glided towards the bedroom, silently opened the door, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stayed rooted to the spot for a very long time until it occurred to me&nbsp;</p>
<p>to leave the bed. I retrieved my watch from where it had fallen on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>floor and turned it towards the light of the moon. It was 3.40. I went to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the kitchen and drank a few glasses of water before stretching out in&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed again, but sleep never came until the morning sunlight crept into&nbsp;</p>
<p>every corner of the room, dissolving all traces of the moon's pale&nbsp;</p>
<p>glow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was somewhere on the edge of sleep when Reiko came and slapped&nbsp;</p>
<p>me on the cheek, shouting, "Morning! Morning!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Reiko straightened out my sofa bed, Naoko went to the kitchen&nbsp;</p>
<p>and started making breakfast. She smiled at me and said "Good&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good morning," I replied. I stood by and watched her as she put on&nbsp;</p>
<p>water to boil and sliced some bread, humming all the while, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could sense nothing in her manner to suggest that she had revealed her&nbsp;</p>
<p>naked body to me the night before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your eyes are red," she said to me as she poured the coffee. "Are you&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I bet we were snoring," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>160&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's good," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's just being polite," said Reiko, yawning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I thought that Naoko was embarrassed or acting innocent for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko, but her behaviour remained unchanged when Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>momentarily left the room, and her eyes had their usual transparent&nbsp;</p>
<p>look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How'd you sleep?" I asked Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like a log," she answered with ease. She wore a simple hairpin&nbsp;</p>
<p>without any kind of decoration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know what to make of this, and I continued to feel that way all&nbsp;</p>
<p>through breakfast. Buttering my bread or peeling my egg, I kept&nbsp;</p>
<p>glancing across the table at Naoko, in search of a sign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why do you keep looking at me like that?" she asked with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think he's in love with somebody," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you in love with somebody?" Naoko asked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Could be," I said, returning her smile. When the two women started&nbsp;</p>
<p>joking around at my expense, I gave up trying to think about what had&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened in the night and concentrated on my bread and coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After breakfast, Reiko and Naoko said they would be going to feed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>birds in the aviary. I volunteered to go along. They changed into jeans&nbsp;</p>
<p>and work shirts and white rubber boots. Set in a little park behind the&nbsp;</p>
<p>tennis courts, the aviary had everything in it from chickens and&nbsp;</p>
<p>pigeons to peacocks and parrots and was surrounded by flowerbeds,&nbsp;</p>
<p>shrubberies and benches. Two men in their forties, also apparently&nbsp;</p>
<p>sanatorium patients, were raking up leaves that had fallen in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>pathways. The women walked over to say good morning to the pair,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Reiko made them laugh with another of her jokes. Cosmos were&nbsp;</p>
<p>blooming in the flowerbeds, and the shrubberies were extremely well&nbsp;</p>
<p>manicured. Spotting Reiko, the birds started chattering and flying&nbsp;</p>
<p>about inside the cage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The women entered the shed by the cage and came out with a bag of&nbsp;</p>
<p>161&nbsp;</p>
<p>feed and a garden hose. Naoko screwed the hose to a tap and turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the water. Taking care to prevent any birds from flying out, the two&nbsp;</p>
<p>of them slipped into the cage, Naoko hosing down the dirt and Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>scrubbing the floor of the cage with a deck brush. The spray sparkled&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the glare of the morning sun. The peacocks flapped around the cage&nbsp;</p>
<p>to avoid getting splashed. A turkey raised its head and glowered at me&nbsp;</p>
<p>like a crotchety old man, while a parrot on the perch above screeched&nbsp;</p>
<p>its displeasure and beat its wings. Reiko meowed at the parrot, which&nbsp;</p>
<p>slunk over to the far corner but soon was calling: "Thank you!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Crazy!" "Shithead!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder who taught him that kind of language?" said Naoko with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not me," said Reiko. "I would never do such a thing." She started&nbsp;</p>
<p>meowing again, and the parrot shut up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laughing, Reiko explained, "This guy once had a run-in with a cat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now he's scared to death of them."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they had finished cleaning, the two set down their tools and&nbsp;</p>
<p>went around filling each of the feeders. Splashing its way through&nbsp;</p>
<p>puddles on the floor, the turkey darted to its feed box and plunged its&nbsp;</p>
<p>head in, too obsessed with eating to be bothered by Naoko's smacks&nbsp;</p>
<p>on its tail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you do this every morning?" I asked Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every morning!" she said. "They usually give this job to new women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's so easy. Like to see the rabbits?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure," I said. The rabbit hutch was behind the aviary. Some ten&nbsp;</p>
<p>rabbits lay inside, asleep in the straw. Naoko swept up their droppings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>put feed in their box, and picked up one of the babies, rubbing it&nbsp;</p>
<p>against her cheek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Isn't it precious?" she gushed. She let me hold it. The warm, little ball&nbsp;</p>
<p>of fur cringed in my arms, twitching its nose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry, he won't hurt you," she said to the rabbit, stroking its&nbsp;</p>
<p>head with her finger and smiling at me. It was such a radiant smile,&nbsp;</p>
<p>162&nbsp;</p>
<p>without a trace of shadow, that I couldn't help smiling myself. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>what about Naoko last night? I wondered. I knew for certain that it&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been the real Naoko and not a dream: she had definitely taken her&nbsp;</p>
<p>clothes off and shown her naked body to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko whistled a lovely rendition of "Proud Mary" as she stuffed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>plastic bag with the debris they had gathered and tied the opening. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>helped them carry the tools and feed bag to the shed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Morning is my favourite time of day," said Naoko. "It's like&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything's starting out fresh and new. I begin to get sad around noon&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, and I hate it when the sun goes down. I live with those same&nbsp;</p>
<p>feelings clay aster day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And while you're living with those feelings, you youngsters get old&nbsp;</p>
<p>just like me," said Reiko with a smile. "You're thinking about how it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning now or night and the next thing you know, you're old."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you like getting old," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not really," said Reiko. "But I sure don't wish I was young again."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why not?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because it's such a pain in the neck!" she said. Then she tossed her&nbsp;</p>
<p>broom in and closed the door of the shed, whistling "Proud Mary" all&nbsp;</p>
<p>the while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back at the flat, the women changed their boots for tennis shoes and&nbsp;</p>
<p>said they were going to the farm. Reiko suggested I stayed behind&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a book or something because the work would be no fun to watch&nbsp;</p>
<p>and they would be doing it as part of a group. "And while you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>waiting you can wash the pile of dirty underwear we left by the sink,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're kidding," I said, taken aback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I am," she laughed. "You're so sweet. Isn't he, Naoko?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He really is," said Naoko, laughing with her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll work on my German," I said with a sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, do your homework like a good boy," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>163&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We'll be back before lunch."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two of them went out tittering. I heard the footsteps and voices of&nbsp;</p>
<p>a number of people walking by downstairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into the bathroom and washed my face again, then borrowed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>nail clipper and trimmed my nails. For a bathroom that was being&nbsp;</p>
<p>shared by two women, its contents were incredibly simple. Aside from&nbsp;</p>
<p>some neatly arranged bottles&nbsp;</p>
<p>of cleansing cream and lip moisturizer and sun block, there was&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost nothing that could be called cosmetics. When I finished&nbsp;</p>
<p>trimming my nails, I made myself some coffee and drank it at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>kitchen table, German book open. Stripping down to a T-shirt in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sun-filled kitchen, I had set about memorizing all the forms in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>grammar chart when I was struck by an odd feeling. It seemed to me&nbsp;</p>
<p>that the longest imaginable distance separated irregular German verb&nbsp;</p>
<p>forms from this kitchen table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two women came back from the farm at 11.30, took turns in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>shower, and changed into fresh clothes. The three of us went to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dining hall for lunch, then walked to the front gate. This time the&nbsp;</p>
<p>guardhouse had a man on duty. He was sitting at his desk, enjoying a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lunch that must have been brought to him from the dining hall. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>transistor radio on the shelf was playing a sentimental old pop tune.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He waved to us with a friendly "Hi" as we approached, and we&nbsp;</p>
<p>hello'ed him back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko explained to him that we were going to walk outside the&nbsp;</p>
<p>grounds and return in three hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great," he said. "You're lucky with the weather. Just stay away from&nbsp;</p>
<p>the valley road, though. It got washed out in that big rain. No problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>anywhere else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko wrote her name and Naoko's in a register along with the date&nbsp;</p>
<p>and time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Enjoy yourselves," said the guard. "And take care."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nice guy," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>164&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's a little strange up here," said Reiko, touching her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had been right about the weather, though. The sky was a fresh</p>
<p>swept blue, with only a trace of white cloud clinging to the dome of&nbsp;</p>
<p>heaven like a thin streak of test paint. We walked beside the low stone&nbsp;</p>
<p>wall of Ami Hostel for a time, then moved away to climb a steep,&nbsp;</p>
<p>narrow trail in single file. Reiko led the way, with Naoko in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>middle and me bringing up the rear. Reiko climbed with the confident&nbsp;</p>
<p>stride of one who knew every stretch of every mountain in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We concentrated on walking, with hardly a word among us. Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>wore blue jeans and a white blouse and carried her jacket in one hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I watched her long, straight hair swaying right and left where it met&nbsp;</p>
<p>her shoulders. She would glance back at me now and then, smiling&nbsp;</p>
<p>when our eyes met. The trail continued upwards so far that it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost dizzying, but Reiko's pace never slackened. Naoko hurried to&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep up with her, wiping the sweat from her face. Not having indulged&nbsp;</p>
<p>in such outdoor activities for some time, I found myself running short&nbsp;</p>
<p>of breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you do this a lot?" I asked Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe once a week," she answered. "Having a tough time?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Kind of," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're almost there," said Reiko. "This is about two-thirds of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on, you're a boy, aren't you?" "Yeah, but I'm out of shape."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Playing with girls all the time," muttered Naoko, as if to herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to answer her, but I was too winded to speak. Every now and&nbsp;</p>
<p>then, red birds with tufts on their heads would flit across our path,&nbsp;</p>
<p>brilliant against the blue sky. The fields around us were filled with&nbsp;</p>
<p>white and blue and yellow flowers, and bees buzzed everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving ahead one step at a time, I thought of nothing but the scene&nbsp;</p>
<p>passing before my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slope gave out after another ten minutes, and we gained a level&nbsp;</p>
<p>plateau. We rested there, wiping the sweat off, catching&nbsp;</p>
<p>our breath and drinking from our water bottles. Reiko found a leaf and&nbsp;</p>
<p>165&nbsp;</p>
<p>used it to make a whistle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trail entered a gentle downward slope amid tall, waving thickets&nbsp;</p>
<p>of plume grass. We walked on for some 15 minutes before passing&nbsp;</p>
<p>through a village. There were no signs of humanity here, and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dozen or so houses were all in varying states of decay. Waist-high&nbsp;</p>
<p>grass grew among the houses, and dry, white gobs of pigeon&nbsp;</p>
<p>droppings clung to holes in the walls. Only the pillars survived in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>case of one collapsed building, while others looked ready to be lived&nbsp;</p>
<p>in as soon as you opened the storm shutters. These dead, silent houses&nbsp;</p>
<p>pressed against either side of the road as we slipped through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"People lived in this village until seven or eight years ago," Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>informed me. "This was farmland around here. But they all cleared&nbsp;</p>
<p>out. Life was just too hard. They'd be trapped when the snow piled up&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the winter. And the soil isn't particularly fertile. They could make a&nbsp;</p>
<p>better living in the city."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What a waste," I said. "Some of the houses look perfectly usable."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some hippies tried living here at one point, but they gave up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couldn't take the winters."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little beyond the village we came to a big fenced area that seemed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>be a pasture. Far away on the other side, I caught sight of a few horses&nbsp;</p>
<p>grazing. We followed the fence line, and a big dog came running over&nbsp;</p>
<p>to us, tail wagging. It stood up leaning on Reiko, sniffing her face,&nbsp;</p>
<p>then jumped playfully on Naoko. I whistled and it came over to me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>licking my hand with its long tongue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko patted the dog's head and explained that the animal belonged to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the pasture. "I'll bet he's close to 20," she said. "His teeth are so bad,&nbsp;</p>
<p>he can't eat anything hard. He sleeps in front of the shop all day, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>he comes running when he hears footsteps."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko took a scrap of cheese from her rucksack. Catching its scent, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dog bounded over to her and chomped down on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We won't be able to see this fellow much longer," said Reiko, patting&nbsp;</p>
<p>the dog's head. "In the middle of October they put the horses and cows&nbsp;</p>
<p>166&nbsp;</p>
<p>in trucks and take 'em down to the barn. The only time they let 'em&nbsp;</p>
<p>graze is the summer, when they open a little café kind of thing for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>tourists. The "tourists'! Maybe 20 hikers in a day. Hey, how about&nbsp;</p>
<p>something to drink?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good idea," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dog led the way to the café, a small, white house with a front&nbsp;</p>
<p>porch and a faded sign in the shape of a coffee cup hanging from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>eaves. He led us up the steps and stretched out on the porch,&nbsp;</p>
<p>narrowing his eyes. When we took our places around a table on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>porch, a girl with a ponytail and wearing a sweatshirt and white jeans&nbsp;</p>
<p>came out and greeted Reiko and Naoko like old friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is a friend of Naoko's," said Reiko, introducing me. "Hi," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hi," I answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the three women traded small talk, I stroked the neck of the dog&nbsp;</p>
<p>under the table. It had the hard, stringy neck of an old dog. When I&nbsp;</p>
<p>scratched the lumpy spots, the dog closed his eyes and sighed with&nbsp;</p>
<p>pleasure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's his name?" I asked the girl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pepé," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Pepé," I said to the dog, but he didn't budge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's hard of hearing," said the girl. "You have to speak up or he can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>hear."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pepé!" I shouted. The dog opened his eyes and snapped to attention&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a bark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never mind, Pepé," said the girl. "Sleep more and live longer." Pepé&nbsp;</p>
<p>flopped down again at my feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and Reiko ordered cold glasses of milk and I asked for a beer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's hear the radio," said Reiko. The girl switched on an amplifier&nbsp;</p>
<p>and tuned into an FM station. Blood, Sweat and Tears came on with&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Spinning Wheel".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko looked pleased. "Now this is what we're here for! We don't have&nbsp;</p>
<p>167&nbsp;</p>
<p>radios in our rooms, so if I don't come here once in a while, I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have any idea what's playing out there."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you sleep in this place?" I asked the girl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way!" she laughed. "I'd die of loneliness if I spent the night here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pasture guy drives me into town and I come out again in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning." She pointed at a four-wheel drive truck parked in front of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the nearby pasture office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You've got a holiday coming up soon, too, right?" asked Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, we'll be shutting up this place soon," said the girl. Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>offered her a cigarette, and they smoked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll miss you," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll be back in May, though," said the girl with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cream came on the radio with "White Room". After a commercial, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was Simon and Garfunkel's "Scarborough Fair".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like that," said Reiko when it was over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I saw the film," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Who's in it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Dustin Hoffman."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know him," she said with a sad little shake of the head. "The&nbsp;</p>
<p>world changes like mad, and I don't know what's happening." She&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked the girl for a guitar. "Sure," said the girl, switching off the radio&nbsp;</p>
<p>and bringing out an old guitar. The dog raised its head and sniffed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't eat this," Reiko said with mock sternness. A grass-scented&nbsp;</p>
<p>breeze swept over the porch. The mountains lay spread out before us,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the ridge line sharp against the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's like a scene from The Sound of Music," I said to Reiko as she&nbsp;</p>
<p>tuned up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's that?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She strummed the guitar in search of the opening chord of&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Scarborough Fair". This was apparently her first attempt at the song,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but after a few false starts she could play it through without hesitating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>168&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had it down pat the third time and even started adding a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>flourishes. "Good ear," she said to me with a wink. "I can usually play&nbsp;</p>
<p>just about anything if I hear it three times."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Softly humming the melody, she did a full rendition of "Scarborough&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fair". The three of us applauded, and Reiko responded with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>decorous bow of the head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I used to get more applause for a Mozart concerto," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her milk was on the house if she would play the Beatles' "Here Comes&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Sun", said the girl. Reiko gave her a thumbs up and launched into&nbsp;</p>
<p>the song. Hers was not a full voice, and too much smoking had given&nbsp;</p>
<p>it a husky edge, but it was lovely, with real presence. I almost felt as if&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sun really was coming up again as I sat there listening and&nbsp;</p>
<p>drinking beer and looking at the mountains. It was a soft, warm&nbsp;</p>
<p>feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko gave back the guitar and asked to hear the radio again. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>suggested to Naoko and me that we take an hour and walk around the&nbsp;</p>
<p>area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I want to listen to the radio some more and hang out&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her. If you come back by three, that should be OK."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is it all right for us to be alone together so long?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, actually, it's against the rules, but what the hell. I'm not a&nbsp;</p>
<p>chaperone, after all. I could use a break. And you came all the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>from Tokyo, I'm sure there's tons of stuff you want to talk about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko lit another cigarette as she spoke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's go," said Naoko, standing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started after her. The dog woke up and followed us for a while, but it&nbsp;</p>
<p>soon lost interest and went back to its place on the porch. We strolled&nbsp;</p>
<p>down a level road that followed the pasture fence. Naoko would take&nbsp;</p>
<p>my hand every now and then or slip her arm under mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is kind of like the old days, isn't it?" she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That wasn't 'the old days'," I laughed. "It was spring of this year! If&nbsp;</p>
<p>that was 'the old days', ten years ago was ancient history."&nbsp;</p>
<p>169&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It feels like ancient history," said Naoko. "But anyway, sorry about&nbsp;</p>
<p>last night. I don't know, I was a bundle of nerves. I really shouldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have done that after you came here all the way from Tokyo."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never mind," I said. "Both of us have a lot of feelings we need to get&nbsp;</p>
<p>out in the open. So if you want to take those feelings and smash&nbsp;</p>
<p>somebody with them, smash me. Then we can understand each other&nbsp;</p>
<p>better."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So if you understand me better, what then?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You don't get it, do you?" I said. "It's not a question of what then'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people get a kick out of reading railway timetables and that's all&nbsp;</p>
<p>they do all day. Some people make huge model boats out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>matchsticks. So what's wrong if there happens to be one guy in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>world who enjoys trying to understand you?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Kind of like a hobby?" she said, amused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess you could call it a hobby. Most normal people would&nbsp;</p>
<p>call it friendship or love or something, but if you want to call it a&nbsp;</p>
<p>hobby, that's OK, too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me," said Naoko, "you liked Kizuki, too, didn't you?" "Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about Reiko?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like her a lot," I said. "She's really nice."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How come you always like people like that - people like us, I mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're all kind of weird and twisted and drowning - me and Kizuki and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko. Why can't you like more normal people?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because I don't see you like that," I said after giving it some thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't see you or Kizuki or Reiko as "twisted' in any way. The guys I&nbsp;</p>
<p>think of as twisted are out there running around."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But we are twisted," said Naoko. "I can see that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We walked on in silence. The road left the fence and came out to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>circular grassy field ringed with trees like a pond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night so scared," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko, pressing up against my arm. "I'm scared I'll never get better&nbsp;</p>
<p>170&nbsp;</p>
<p>again. I'll always stay twisted like this and grow old and waste away&nbsp;</p>
<p>here. I get so chilled it's like I'm all frozen inside. It's horrible ... so&nbsp;</p>
<p>cold. .. "&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put my arm around her and drew her close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I feel like Kizuki is reaching out for me from the darkness,&nbsp;</p>
<p>calling to me, "Hey, Naoko, we can't stay apart.' When I hear him&nbsp;</p>
<p>saying that, I don't know what to do." "What do you do?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well ... don't take this the wrong way, now." "OK, I won't."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I ask Reiko to hold me. I wake her up and crawl into her bed and let&nbsp;</p>
<p>her hold me tight. And I cry. And she strokes me until the ice melts&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I'm warm again. Do you think it's sick?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No. I wish I could be the one to hold you, though," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So hold me. Now. Right here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sat down on the dry grass of the meadow and put our arms around&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other. The tall grass surrounded us, and we could see nothing but&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sky and clouds above. I gently lay Naoko down and took her in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>arms. She was soft and warm and her hands reached out for me. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>kissed with real feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me something, Toru," Naoko whispered in my ear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's that?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you want to sleep with me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I do," I said. "Can you wait?" "Of course I can."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Before we do it again, I want to get myself a little better. I want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>make myself into a person more worthy of that hobby of yours. Will&nbsp;</p>
<p>you wait for me to do that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I'll wait." "Are you hard now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean the soles of my feet?" "Silly," Naoko tittered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you're asking whether I have an erection, of course I do." "Will&nbsp;</p>
<p>you do me a favour and stop saying "Of course'?" "OK, I'll stop."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is it difficult?" "What?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To be all hard like that." "Difficult?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I mean, are you suffering?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>171&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, it depends how you look at it."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Want me to help you get rid of it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With your hand?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. To tell you the truth," said Naoko, "it's been sticking into me&nbsp;</p>
<p>ever since we lay down. It hurts." I pulled my hips away. "Better?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know?" I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wish you would do it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK," she said with a kind smile. Then she unzipped my trousers and&nbsp;</p>
<p>took my stiff penis in her hand. "It's warm," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She started to move her hand, but I stopped her and unbuttoned her&nbsp;</p>
<p>blouse, reaching around to undo her bra strap. I kissed her soft, pink&nbsp;</p>
<p>nipples. She closed her eyes and slowly started moving her fingers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, you're pretty good at that," I said. "Be a good boy and shut up,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I came, I held her in my arms and kissed her again. Naoko did&nbsp;</p>
<p>up her bra and blouse, and I zipped up my flies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Will that make it easier for you to walk?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I owe it all to you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, then, Sir, if it suits you, shall we walk a little farther?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"By all means."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cut across the meadow, through a stand of trees, and across&nbsp;</p>
<p>another meadow. Naoko talked about her dead sister, explaining that&nbsp;</p>
<p>although she had hardly said anything about this to anyone, she felt&nbsp;</p>
<p>she ought to tell me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She was six years older than me, and our personalities were totally&nbsp;</p>
<p>different, but still we were very close. We never fought, not once. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>true. Of course, with such a big difference in our ages, there was&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing much for us to fight about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her sister was one of those girls who are successful at every&nbsp;</p>
<p>172&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing - a super-student, a super-athlete, popular, a leader, kind,&nbsp;</p>
<p>straightforward, the boys liked her, her teachers loved her, her walls&nbsp;</p>
<p>were covered with certificates of merit. There's always one girl like&nbsp;</p>
<p>that in any school. "I'm not saying this because she's my sister, but she&nbsp;</p>
<p>never let any of this spoil her or make her the least bit stuck-up or a&nbsp;</p>
<p>show-off. It's just that, no matter what you gave her to do, she would&nbsp;</p>
<p>naturally do it better than anyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So when I was little, I decided that I was going to be the sweet little&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl." Naoko twirled a frond of plume grass as she spoke. "I mean, you&nbsp;</p>
<p>know, I grew up hearing everybody talking about how smart she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>and how good she was at games and how popular she was. Of course&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to assume there's no way I could ever compete with her. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>face, at least, was a little prettier than hers, so I guess my parents&nbsp;</p>
<p>decided they'd bring me up cute. Right from the start they put me in&nbsp;</p>
<p>that kind of school. They dressed me in velvet dresses and frilly&nbsp;</p>
<p>blouses and patent leather shoes and gave me piano lessons and ballet&nbsp;</p>
<p>lessons. This just made my sister even crazier about me - you know: I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was her cute little sister. She'd give me these cute little presents and&nbsp;</p>
<p>take me everywhere with her and help me with my homework. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>even took me along on dates. She was the best big sister anyone could&nbsp;</p>
<p>ask for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nobody knew why she killed herself. The same as Kizuki. Exactly&nbsp;</p>
<p>the same. She was 17, too, and she never gave the slightest hint she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was going to commit suicide. She didn't leave a note, either. Really, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was exactly the same, don't you think?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds like it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Everybody said she was too smart or she read too many books. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>she did read a lot. She had tons of books. I read a bunch of them after&nbsp;</p>
<p>she died, and it was so sad. They had her comments in the margins&nbsp;</p>
<p>and flowers pressed between the pages and letters from boyfriends,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and every time I came across something like that I'd cry. I cried a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko fell silent for a few seconds, twirling the plume grass again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>173&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She was the kind of person who took care of things by herself. She'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>never ask anybody for advice or help. It wasn't a matter of pride, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>think. She just did what seemed natural to her. My parents were used&nbsp;</p>
<p>to this and thought she'd be OK if they left her alone. I would go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>my sister for advice and she was always ready to give it, but she never&nbsp;</p>
<p>went to anyone else. She did what needed to be done, on her own. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>never got angry or moody. This is all true, I mean it, I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>exaggerating. Most girls, when they have their period or something,&nbsp;</p>
<p>will get grumpy and take it out on others, but she never even did that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of getting into a bad mood, she would become very subdued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe once in two or three months this would happen to her: she'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>shut herself up in her room and stay in bed, avoid school, hardly eat a&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing, turn the lights off, and space out. She wouldn't be in a bad&nbsp;</p>
<p>mood, though. When I came home from school, she'd call me into her&nbsp;</p>
<p>room and sit me down next to her and ask me about my day. I'd tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>her all the little things - like what kinds of games I played with my&nbsp;</p>
<p>friends or what the teacher said or my exam results, stuff like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She'd take in every detail and make comments and suggestions, but as&nbsp;</p>
<p>soon as I left - to play with a friend, say, or go to a ballet lesson - she'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>space out again. After two days, she'd snap out of it just like that and&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>school. This kind of thing went on for, I don't know, maybe&nbsp;</p>
<p>four years. My parents were worried at first and I think they went to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>doctor for advice, but, I mean, she'd be perfectly fine after two days,&nbsp;</p>
<p>so they thought it would work itself out if they left her alone, she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>such a bright, steady girl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"After she died, though, I heard my parents talking about a younger&nbsp;</p>
<p>brother of my father's who had died long before. He had also been&nbsp;</p>
<p>very bright, but he had stayed shut up in the house for four years -&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the time he was 17 until he was 21. And then suddenly one day&nbsp;</p>
<p>he left the house and jumped in front of a train. My father said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe it's in the blood - from my side'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>174&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Naoko was speaking, her fingers unconsciously teased the&nbsp;</p>
<p>tassel of the plume grass, scattering its fibres to the wind. When the&nbsp;</p>
<p>shaft was bare, she wound it around her fingers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was the one who found my sister dead," she went on. "In autumn&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I was in the first year. November. On a dark, rainy day. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>sister was in the sixth-form at the time. I came home from my piano&nbsp;</p>
<p>lesson at 6.30 and my mother was making dinner. She told me to tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>my sister it was ready. I went upstairs and knocked on her door and&nbsp;</p>
<p>yelled "Dinner's ready', but there was no answer. Her room was&nbsp;</p>
<p>completely silent. I thought this was strange, so I knocked again,&nbsp;</p>
<p>opened the door and peeped inside. I thought she was probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleeping. She wasn't in bed, though. She was standing by the window,&nbsp;</p>
<p>staring outside, with her neck bent at a kind of angle like this, like she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was thinking. The room was dark, the lights were out, and it was hard&nbsp;</p>
<p>to see anything. "What are you doing?' I said to her. "Dinner is ready.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's when I noticed that she looked taller than usual. What was&nbsp;</p>
<p>going on? I wondered: it was so strange! Did she have high heels on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was she standing on something? I moved closer and was just about to&nbsp;</p>
<p>speak to her again when I saw it: there was a rope above her head. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>came straight down from a beam in the ceiling - I mean it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>amazingly straight, like somebody had drawn a line in space with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>ruler. My sister had a white blouse on - yeah, a simple white blouse&nbsp;</p>
<p>like this one - and a grey skirt, and her toes were pointing down like a&nbsp;</p>
<p>ballerina's, except there was a space between the tip of her toes and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the floor of maybe seven or eight inches. I took in every detail. Her&nbsp;</p>
<p>face, too. I looked at her face. I couldn't help it. I thought: I've got to&nbsp;</p>
<p>go right downstairs and tell my mother. I've got to scream. But my&nbsp;</p>
<p>body ignored me. It moved on its own, separately from my conscious&nbsp;</p>
<p>mind. It was trying to lower her from the rope while my mind was&nbsp;</p>
<p>telling me to hurry downstairs. Of course, there was no way a little&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl could have the strength to do such a thing, and so I just stood&nbsp;</p>
<p>there, spacing out, for maybe five or six minutes, a total blank, like&nbsp;</p>
<p>175&nbsp;</p>
<p>something inside me had died. I just stayed that way, with my sister,&nbsp;</p>
<p>in that cold, dark place until my mother came up to see what was&nbsp;</p>
<p>going on."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko shook her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For three days after that I couldn't talk. I just lay in bed like a dead&nbsp;</p>
<p>person, eyes wide open and staring into space. I didn't know what was&nbsp;</p>
<p>happening." Naoko pressed against my arm. "I told you in my letter,&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't I? I'm a far more flawed human being than you realize. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>sickness is a lot worse than you think: it has far deeper roots. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>that's why I want you to go on ahead of me if you can. Don't wait for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. Sleep with other girls if you want to. Don't let thoughts of me hold&nbsp;</p>
<p>you back. Just do what you want to do. Otherwise, I might end up&nbsp;</p>
<p>taking you with me, and that is the one thing I don't want to do. I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to interfere with your life. I don't want to interfere with&nbsp;</p>
<p>anybody's life. Like I said before, I want you to come to see me every&nbsp;</p>
<p>once in a while, and always remember me. That's all I want."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's not all I want, though," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're wasting your life being involved with me." "I'm not wasting&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I might never recover. Will you wait for me forever?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you wait 10 years, 20 years?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're letting yourself be scared by too many things," I said. "The&nbsp;</p>
<p>dark, bad dreams, the power of the dead. You have to forget them. I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>sure you'll get well if you do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If I can," said Naoko, shaking her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you can get out of this place, will you live with me?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then I can protect you from the dark and from bad dreams. Then&nbsp;</p>
<p>you'd have me instead of Reiko to hold you when things got difficult."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko pressed still more firmly against me. "That would be&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got back to the cafe a little before three. Reiko was reading a book&nbsp;</p>
<p>176&nbsp;</p>
<p>and listening to Brahms' Second Piano Concerto on the radio. There&nbsp;</p>
<p>was something wonderful about Brahms playing at the edge of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>grassy meadow without a sign of anyone as far as the eye could see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko was whistling along with the cello passage that begins the third&nbsp;</p>
<p>movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Backhaus and Bohm," she said. "I wore this record out once, a long&nbsp;</p>
<p>time ago. Literally. I wore the grooves out listening to every note. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>sucked the music right out of it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and I ordered coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do a lot of talking?" asked Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tons," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me all about his, uh, you know, later."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We didn't do any of that," said Naoko, reddening. "Really?" Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked me. "Nothing?" "Nothing," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Bo-o-o-ring!" she said with a bored look on her face. "True," I said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>sipping my coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scene in the dining hall was the same as the day before - the&nbsp;</p>
<p>mood, the voices, the faces. Only the menu had changed. The balding&nbsp;</p>
<p>man in white, who yesterday had been talking about the secretion of&nbsp;</p>
<p>gastric juices under weightless conditions, joined the three of us at our&nbsp;</p>
<p>table and talked for a long time about the correlation of brain size to&nbsp;</p>
<p>intelligence. As we ate our soybean burgers, we heard all about the&nbsp;</p>
<p>volume of Bismarck's brain and Napoleon's. He pushed his plate aside&nbsp;</p>
<p>and used a ballpoint pen and notepaper to draw sketches of brains. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>would start to draw, declare "No, that's not quite it", and begin a new&nbsp;</p>
<p>one. This happened several times. When he had finished, he carefully&nbsp;</p>
<p>put the remaining notepaper away in a pocket of his white jacket and&nbsp;</p>
<p>slipped the pen into his breast pocket, in which he kept a total of three&nbsp;</p>
<p>pens, along with pencils and a ruler. Having finished his meal, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>repeated what he had told me the day before, "The winters here are&nbsp;</p>
<p>really nice. Make sure you come back when it's winter," and left the&nbsp;</p>
<p>177&nbsp;</p>
<p>dining hall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is he a doctor or a patient?" I asked Reiko. "Which do you think?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really can't tell. In either case, he doesn't seem all that normal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's a doctor," said Naoko. "Doctor Miyata."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Reiko, "but I bet he's the craziest one here." "Mr Omura,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the gatekeeper, is pretty crazy, too," answered&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"True," said Reiko, nodding as she stabbed her broccoli. "He does&nbsp;</p>
<p>these wild callisthenics every morning, screaming nonsense at the top&nbsp;</p>
<p>of his lungs. And before you came, Naoko, there was a girl in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>business office, Miss Kinoshita, who tried to kill herself. And last year&nbsp;</p>
<p>they sacked a male nurse, Tokushima, who had a terrible drinking&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds like patients and staff should swap places," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right on," said Reiko, waving her fork in the air. "You're finally&nbsp;</p>
<p>starting to see how things work here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose so."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What makes us most normal," said Reiko, "is knowing that we're not&nbsp;</p>
<p>normal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the room, Naoko and I played cards while Reiko practised&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bach on her guitar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What time are you leaving tomorrow?" Reiko asked me, taking a&nbsp;</p>
<p>break and lighting a cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Straight after breakfast," I said. "The bus comes at nine. That way I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can get back in time for tomorrow night's work."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Too bad. It'd be nice if you could stay longer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If I stayed around too long, I might end up living here," I said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe so," Reiko said. Then, to Naoko, she said, "Oh, yeah, I've got&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go get some grapes at Oka's. I totally forgot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Want me to go with you?" asked Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>178&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about letting me borrow your young Mr Watanabe here?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," said Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good. Let's just the two of us go for another nighttime stroll," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko, taking my hand. "We Yesterday. Let's go all the way tonight."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," said Naoko, tittering. "Do what you like."&nbsp;</p>
<p>were almost there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night air was cool. Reiko wore a pale blue cardigan over her shirt&nbsp;</p>
<p>and walked with her hands shoved in her jeans pockets. Looking up at&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sky, she sniffed the breeze like a dog. "Smells like rain," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried sniffing too, but couldn't smell anything. True, there were lots&nbsp;</p>
<p>of clouds in the sky obscuring the moon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you stay here long enough, you can pretty much tell the weather by&nbsp;</p>
<p>the smell of the air," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We entered the wooded area where the staff houses stood. Reiko told&nbsp;</p>
<p>me to wait a minute, walked over to the front door of one house and&nbsp;</p>
<p>rang the bell. A woman came to the door - no doubt the lady of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>house - and stood there chatting and chuckling with Reiko. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>ducked inside and came back with a large plastic bag. Reiko thanked&nbsp;</p>
<p>her and said goodnight before returning to the spot where I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>waiting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look," she said, opening the bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It held a huge cluster of grapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you like grapes?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Love them."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She handed me the top bunch. "It's OK to eat them. They're washed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We walked along eating grapes and spitting the skins and seeds on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ground. They were fresh and delicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I give their son piano lessons once in a while, and they offer me&nbsp;</p>
<p>different stuff. The wine we had was from them. I sometimes ask them&nbsp;</p>
<p>to do a little shopping for me in town."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like to hear the rest of the story you were telling me yesterday," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>179&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," said Reiko. "But if we keep coming home late, Naoko might&nbsp;</p>
<p>start getting suspicious."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm willing to risk it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, then. I want a roof, though. It's a little chilly tonight."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She turned left as we approached the tennis courts. We went down a&nbsp;</p>
<p>narrow stairway and came out at a spot where several storehouses&nbsp;</p>
<p>stood like a block of houses. Reiko opened the door of the nearest one,&nbsp;</p>
<p>stepped in and turned on the lights. "Come in," she said. "There's not&nbsp;</p>
<p>much to see, though."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storehouse contained neat rows of cross-country skis, boots and&nbsp;</p>
<p>poles, and on the floor were piled snow removal equipment and bags&nbsp;</p>
<p>of rock salt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I used to come here all the time for guitar practice - when I wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>be alone. Nice and cosy, isn't it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko sat on the bags of rock salt and invited me to sit next to her. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>did as I was told.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not much ventilation here, but mind if I smoke?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Go ahead," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is one habit I can't seem to break," she said with a frown, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>she lit up with obvious enjoyment. Not many people enjoy tobacco as&nbsp;</p>
<p>much as Reiko did. I ate my grapes, carefully peeling them one at a&nbsp;</p>
<p>time and tossing the skins and seeds into a tin that served as a rubbish&nbsp;</p>
<p>bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now, let's see, how far did we get last night?" Reiko asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It was a dark and stormy night, and you were climbing the steep cliff&nbsp;</p>
<p>to grab the bird's nest."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're amazing, the way you can joke around with such a straight&nbsp;</p>
<p>face," said Reiko. "Let's see, I think I had got to the point where I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>giving piano lessons to the girl every Saturday morning."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Assuming you can divide everybody in the world into two groups -&nbsp;</p>
<p>180&nbsp;</p>
<p>those who are good at teaching things to people, and those who are not - I pretty much belong to the first group," said Reiko. "I never thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>so when I was young, and I suppose I didn't want to think of myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>that way, but once&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reached a certain age and had attained a degree of selfknowledge I&nbsp;</p>
<p>realized it was true after all: I'm good at teaching people things. Really&nbsp;</p>
<p>good."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I bet you are."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have a lot more patience for others than I have for myself, and I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>much better at bringing out the best in others than in myself. That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>just the kind of person I am. I'm the scratchy stuff on the side of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>matchbox. But that's fine with me. I don't mind at all. Better to be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>first-class matchbox than a second-class match. I got this clear in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>own mind, I'd say, after I started teaching this girl. I had taught a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>others when I was younger, strictly as a sideline, without realizing this&nbsp;</p>
<p>about myself. It was only after I started teaching her that I began to&nbsp;</p>
<p>think of myself that way. Hey - I'm good at teaching people. That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>how well the lessons went.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said yesterday, the girl was nothing special when it came to&nbsp;</p>
<p>technique, and there was no question of her becoming a professional&nbsp;</p>
<p>musician, so I could take it easy. Plus she was going to the kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls' school where anybody with halfdecent marks automatically got&nbsp;</p>
<p>into university, which meant she didn't have to kill herself studying,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and her mother was all for going easy with the lessons, too. So I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>push her to do anything. I knew the first time I met her that she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>the kind of girl you couldn't push to do anything, that she was the kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of child who would be all sweetness and say "Yes, yes,' and absolutely&nbsp;</p>
<p>refuse to do anything she didn't want to do. So the first thing I did was&nbsp;</p>
<p>let her play a piece the way she wanted to - 100 per cent her own way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I would play the same piece several different ways for her, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the two of us would discuss which was best or which way she liked&nbsp;</p>
<p>181&nbsp;</p>
<p>most. Then I'd have her play the piece again, and her performance&nbsp;</p>
<p>would be ten times better than the first. She would see for&nbsp;</p>
<p>herself what worked best and bring those features into her own&nbsp;</p>
<p>playing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko paused for a moment, observing the glowing end of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarette. I went on eating my grapes without a word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know I have a pretty good sense for music, but she was better than&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. I used to think it was such a waste! I thought,&nbsp;</p>
<p>,if only she had started out with a good teacher and received the&nbsp;</p>
<p>proper training, she'd be so much farther along!' But I was wrong. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>wasn't the kind of child who could stand proper training. There just&nbsp;</p>
<p>happen to be people like that. They're blessed with this marvellous&nbsp;</p>
<p>talent, but they can't make the effort to systematize it. They end up&nbsp;</p>
<p>squandering it in little bits and pieces. I've seen my share of people&nbsp;</p>
<p>like that. At first you think they're amazing. They can sight-read some&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrifically difficult piece and do a damn good job playing it all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>way through. You see them do it, and you're overwhelmed. You think,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I could never do that in a million years.' But that's as far as it goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can't take it any further. And why not? Because they won't put in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the effort. They haven't had the discipline pounded into them. They've&nbsp;</p>
<p>been spoiled. They have just enough talent so they've been able to&nbsp;</p>
<p>play things well without any effort and they've had people telling them&nbsp;</p>
<p>how great they are from an early age, so hard work looks stupid to&nbsp;</p>
<p>them. They'll take some piece another kid has to work on for three&nbsp;</p>
<p>weeks and polish it off in half the time, so the teacher assumes they've&nbsp;</p>
<p>put enough into it and lets them go on to the next thing. And they do&nbsp;</p>
<p>that in half the time and go on to the next piece. They never find out&nbsp;</p>
<p>what it means to be hammered by the teacher; they lose out on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>crucial element required for character building. It's a tragedy. I myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>had tendencies like that, but fortunately I had a very tough teacher, so&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kept them in check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, it was a joy to teach her. Like driving down the highway in&nbsp;</p>
<p>182&nbsp;</p>
<p>a high-powered sports car that responds to the slightest touch -&nbsp;</p>
<p>responds too quickly, sometimes. The trick to teaching children like&nbsp;</p>
<p>that is not to praise them too much. They're so used to praise it doesn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>mean anything to them. You've got to dole it out wisely. And you can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>force anything on them. You have to let them choose for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you don't let them rush ahead from one thing to the next: you&nbsp;</p>
<p>make them stop and think. But that's about it. If you do those things,&nbsp;</p>
<p>you'll get good results."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko dropped her cigarette butt on the floor and stamped it out. Then&nbsp;</p>
<p>she took a deep breath as if to calm herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When her lessons ended, we'd have tea and chat. Sometimes I'd show&nbsp;</p>
<p>her certain jazz piano styles - like, this is Bud Powell, or this is&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thelonious Monk. But mostly she talked. And what a talker she was!&nbsp;</p>
<p>She could draw you right in. As I told you yesterday, I think most of&nbsp;</p>
<p>what she said was made up, but it was interesting. She was a keen&nbsp;</p>
<p>observer, a precise user of language, sharp-tongued and funny. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>could stir your emotions. Yes, really, that's what she was so good at -&nbsp;</p>
<p>stirring people's emotions, moving you. And she knew she had this&nbsp;</p>
<p>power. She tried to use it as skilfully and effectively as possible. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>could make you feel whatever she wanted - angry or sad or&nbsp;</p>
<p>sympathetic or disappointed or happy. She would manipulate people's&nbsp;</p>
<p>emotions for no other reason than to test her own powers. Of course, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>only realized this later. At the time, I had no idea what she was doing&nbsp;</p>
<p>to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko shook her head and ate a few grapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It was a sickness," she said. "The girl was sick. She was like the&nbsp;</p>
<p>rotten apple that ruins all the other apples. And no one could cure her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She'll have that sickness until the day she dies. In that sense, she was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sad little creature. I would have&nbsp;</p>
<p>pitied her, too, if I hadn't been one of her victims. I would have seen&nbsp;</p>
<p>her as a victim."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko ate a few more grapes. She seemed to be thinking of how best&nbsp;</p>
<p>183&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go on with her story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, I enjoyed teaching her for a good six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I'd find something she said a little surprising or odd. Or&nbsp;</p>
<p>she'd be talking and I'd have this rush of horror when I realised the&nbsp;</p>
<p>intensity of her hatred for some person was completely irrational, or it&nbsp;</p>
<p>would occur to me that she was just far too clever, and I'd wonder&nbsp;</p>
<p>what she was really thinking. But, after all, everyone has their flaws,&nbsp;</p>
<p>right? And finally, what business was it of mine to question her&nbsp;</p>
<p>personality or character? I was just her piano teacher. All I had to care&nbsp;</p>
<p>about was whether she practised or not. And besides, the truth of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>matter is that I liked her. I liked her a lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Still, I was careful not to tell her anything too personal about myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just had this sixth sense that I'd better not talk about such things. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked me hundreds of questions - she was dying to know more about&nbsp;</p>
<p>me - but I only told her the most harmless stuff, like things about my&nbsp;</p>
<p>childhood or where I'd gone to school, stuff like that. She said she&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to know more about me, but I told her there was nothing to&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell: I'd had a boring life, I had an ordinary husband, an ordinary child,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and a ton of housework. "But I like you so much,' she'd say and look&nbsp;</p>
<p>me right in the eye in this clingy sort of way. It sent a thrill through&nbsp;</p>
<p>me when she did that - a nice thrill. But even so, I never told her more&nbsp;</p>
<p>than I had to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And then one day - a day in May, I think it was - in the middle of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>lesson, she said she felt sick. I saw she was pale and sweating and&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked if she wanted to go home, but she said she thought she'd feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>better if she could just lie down for a while. So I took her - almost&nbsp;</p>
<p>carried her - to the bedroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had such a small sofa, the bed was the only place she could lie&nbsp;</p>
<p>down. She apologized for being a nuisance, but I assured her it was no&nbsp;</p>
<p>bother and asked if she wanted anything to drink. She said no, she just&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted me to stay near her, which I said I'd be glad to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A few minutes later she asked me to rub her back. She sounded as&nbsp;</p>
<p>184&nbsp;</p>
<p>though she was really suffering, and she was sweating like mad, so I&nbsp;</p>
<p>started to give her a good massage. Then she apologized and asked me&nbsp;</p>
<p>if I'd mind taking off her bra, as it was hurting her. So, I don't know, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>did it. She was wearing a skin-tight blouse, and I had to unbutton that&nbsp;</p>
<p>and reach behind and undo the bra hooks. She had big breasts for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>13-year-old. Twice as big as mine. And she wasn't wearing any starter&nbsp;</p>
<p>bra but a real adult model, an expensive one. Of course I'm not paying&nbsp;</p>
<p>all that much attention at the time, and like an idiot I just carry on&nbsp;</p>
<p>rubbing her back. She keeps apologizing in this pitiful voice as if she's&nbsp;</p>
<p>really sorry, and I keep telling her it's OK it's OK."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko tapped the ash from her cigarette to the floor. By then I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>stopped eating grapes and was giving all my attention to her story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"After a while she starts sobbing. "What's wrong?' I ask her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing,' she says. "It's obviously not nothing,' I say. "Tell me the&nbsp;</p>
<p>truth. What's bothering you?' So she says, "I just get like this&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes. I don't know what to do. I'm so lonely and sad, and I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk to anybody, and nobody cares about me. And it hurts so much, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>just get like this. I can't sleep at night, and I don't feel like eating, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>coming here for my lesson is the only thing I have to look forward to.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I say, "You can talk to me. Tell me why this happens to you.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are not going well at home, she says. She can't love her&nbsp;</p>
<p>parents, and they don't love her. Her father is seeing another woman&nbsp;</p>
<p>and is hardly ever around, and that makes her mother half crazy and&nbsp;</p>
<p>she takes it out on the girl; she beats her almost every day and she&nbsp;</p>
<p>hates to go home. So now the girl is really wailing, and her eyes are&nbsp;</p>
<p>full of tears, those beautiful eyes of hers. The sight is enough to make&nbsp;</p>
<p>a god weep. So I tell her, if it's so terrible to go home, she can come to&nbsp;</p>
<p>my place any time she likes. When she hears that, the girl throws her&nbsp;</p>
<p>arms around me and says, "Oh, I'm so sorry, but if I didn't have you I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wouldn't know what to do. Please don't turn your back on me. If you&nbsp;</p>
<p>did that, I'd have nowhere to go.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, I don't know, I hold her head against me and I'm caressing her&nbsp;</p>
<p>185&nbsp;</p>
<p>and saying "There there,' and she's got her arms around me and she's&nbsp;</p>
<p>stroking my back, and soon I'm starting to feel very strange, my whole&nbsp;</p>
<p>body is kind of hot. I mean, here's this picture-perfect beautiful girl&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I'm on the bed with her, and we're hugging, and her hands are&nbsp;</p>
<p>caressing my back in this incredibly sensual way that my own&nbsp;</p>
<p>husband couldn't even begin to match, and I feel all the screws coming&nbsp;</p>
<p>loose in my body every time she touches me, and before I know it she&nbsp;</p>
<p>has my blouse and bra off and she's stroking my breasts. So that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>when it finally hits me that she's an absolute dyed-in-the-wool lesbian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This had happened to me once before, at school, one of the sixth-form&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls. So then I tell her to stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Oh, please,' she says, "just a little more. I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>please believe me, you're the only one I have, oh please, don't turn&nbsp;</p>
<p>your back on me,' and she takes my hand and puts it on her breast -&nbsp;</p>
<p>her very nicely shaped breast, and, sure, I'm a woman, but this electric&nbsp;</p>
<p>something goes through me when my hand makes contact. I have no&nbsp;</p>
<p>idea what to do. I just keep repeating no no no no no, like an idiot. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>as if I'm Paralyzed, I can't move. I had managed to push the girl&nbsp;</p>
<p>away at school, but now I can't do a thing. My body won't take orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's holding my right hand against her with her left hand, and she's&nbsp;</p>
<p>kissing and licking my nipples, and her right hand is caressing my&nbsp;</p>
<p>back, my side, my bottom. So here I am in the bedroom with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>curtains closed and a 13-year-old girl has me practically naked - she's&nbsp;</p>
<p>been taking my clothes off somehow all along - and touching me all&nbsp;</p>
<p>over and I'm writhing with the pleasure of it. Looking back on it now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it seems incredible. I mean, it's insane, don't you think? But at the time&nbsp;</p>
<p>it was as if she had cast a spell on me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko paused to puff at her cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, this is the first time I've ever told a man about it," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said, looking at me. "I'm telling it to you because I think I ought to,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I'm finding it really embarrassing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said, because I didn't know what else to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>186&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This went on for a while, and then her right hand started to move&nbsp;</p>
<p>down, and she touched me through my panties. By then, I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>absolutely soaking wet. I'm ashamed to say it, but I've never been so&nbsp;</p>
<p>wet before or since. I had always thought of myself as sort of&nbsp;</p>
<p>indifferent to sex, so I was astounded to be getting so worked up. So&nbsp;</p>
<p>then she puts these slim, soft fingers of hers inside my panties, and ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>well, you know, I can't bring myself to put it into words. I mean, it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was totally different from when a man puts his clumsy hands on you&nbsp;</p>
<p>there. It was amazing. Really. Like feathers or down. I thought all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>fuses in my head were going to pop. Still, somewhere in my fogged</p>
<p>over brain, the thought occurred to me that I had to put a stop to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I let it happen once, I'd never stop, and if I had to carry around a&nbsp;</p>
<p>secret like that inside me, my head was going to get completely&nbsp;</p>
<p>messed up again. I thought about my daughter, too. What if she saw&nbsp;</p>
<p>me like this? She was supposed to be at my parents' house until three&nbsp;</p>
<p>on&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturdays, but what if something happened and she came home&nbsp;</p>
<p>unexpectedly? This helped me to gather my strength and raise myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the bed. "Stop it now, please stop!' I shouted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But she wouldn't stop. Instead, she yanked my panties down and&nbsp;</p>
<p>started using her tongue. I had rarely let even my husband do that, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>found it so embarrassing, but now I had a 13-year-old girl licking me&nbsp;</p>
<p>all over down there. I just gave up. All I could do was cry. And it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>absolute paradise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Stop it!' I yelled one more time and slapped her on the side of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>face as hard as I could. She finally stopped, raised herself up and&nbsp;</p>
<p>looked into my eyes. The two of us were stark naked, on our knees, in&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed, staring at each other. She was 13, I was 31, but, I don't know,&nbsp;</p>
<p>looking at that body of hers, I felt totally overwhelmed. The image is&nbsp;</p>
<p>still so vivid in my mind. I could hardly believe I was looking at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>body of a 13-year-old girl, and I still can't believe it. By comparison,&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I had for a body was enough to make you cry. Believe me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>187&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was nothing I could say, and so I said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""What's wrong?' she says to me. "You like it this way, don't you? I&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew you would the first time I met you. I know you like it. It's much&nbsp;</p>
<p>better than doing it with a man - isn't it? Look how wet you are. I can&nbsp;</p>
<p>make you feel even better if you'll let me. It's true. I can make you feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>like your body's melting away. You want me to, don't you?' And she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was right. She was much better than my husband. And I did want her&nbsp;</p>
<p>to do it even more! But I couldn't let it happen. "Let's do this once a&nbsp;</p>
<p>week,' she said. "Just once a week. Nobody will find out. It'll be our&nbsp;</p>
<p>little secret'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I got out of bed and put on my dressing-gown and told her to&nbsp;</p>
<p>leave and never come back. She just looked at me. Her eyes were&nbsp;</p>
<p>absolutely flat. I had never seen them like that&nbsp;</p>
<p>before. It was as if they were painted on cardboard. They had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>depth. After she stared at me for a while, she gathered up her clothes&nbsp;</p>
<p>without a word and, as slowly as she could, as though she were&nbsp;</p>
<p>making a show of it, she put on each item, one at a time. Then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>went back into the piano room and took a brush from her bag. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>brushed her hair and wiped the blood from her lips with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>handkerchief, put on her shoes, and left. As she went out, she said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're a lesbian, you know. It's true. You may try to hide it, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>you'll be a lesbian until the day you die'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is it true?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko curved her lips and thought for a while. "Well, it is and it isn't. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>definitely felt better with her than with my husband. That's a fact. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had a time there when I really agonized over the question. Maybe I&nbsp;</p>
<p>really was a lesbian and just hadn't noticed until then. But I don't think&nbsp;</p>
<p>so any more. Which is not to say I don't have the tendencies. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably do have them. But I'm not a lesbian in the proper sense of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>term. I never feel desire when I look at a woman. Know what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>188&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Certain kinds of girls, though, do respond to me, and I can feel it&nbsp;</p>
<p>when that happens. Those are the only times it comes out in me. I can&nbsp;</p>
<p>hold Naoko in my arms, though, and feel nothing special. We go&nbsp;</p>
<p>around in the flat practically naked when the weather's hot, and we&nbsp;</p>
<p>take baths together, sometimes even sleep in the same bed, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing happens. I don't feel a thing. I can see that she has a beautiful&nbsp;</p>
<p>body, but that's all. Actually, Naoko and I played a game once. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>made believe we were lesbians. Want to hear about it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure. Tell me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I told her the story I just told you - we tell each&nbsp;</p>
<p>other everything, you know - Naoko tried an experiment. The two of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us got undressed and she tried caressing me, but it didn't work at all. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>just tickled. I thought I was going to die laughing. Just thinking about&nbsp;</p>
<p>it makes me itchy. She was so clumsy! I'll bet you're glad to hear&nbsp;</p>
<p>that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes I am, to tell the truth."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, that's about it," said Reiko, scratching near an&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyebrow with the tip of her little finger. "After the girl left my house, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>found a chair and sat there spacing out for a while, wondering what to&nbsp;</p>
<p>do. I could hear the dull beating of my heart from deep inside my&nbsp;</p>
<p>body. My arms and legs seemed to weigh a ton, and my mouth felt as&nbsp;</p>
<p>though I'd eaten a moth or something, it was so dry. But I dragged&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself to the bathroom, knowing my daughter would be back soon. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to clean those places where the girl had touched and licked&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. I scrubbed myself with soap, over and over, but I couldn't seem to&nbsp;</p>
<p>get rid of the slimy feeling she had left behind. I knew I was probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>imagining it, but that didn't help. That night, I asked my husband to&nbsp;</p>
<p>make love to me, almost as a way to get rid of the defilement. Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, I didn't tell him anything - I couldn't. All I said to him was that&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted him to take it slow, to give it more time than usual. And he&nbsp;</p>
<p>did. He concentrated on every little detail, he really took a long, long&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, and the way I came that night, oh yes, it was like nothing I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>189&nbsp;</p>
<p>ever experienced before, never once in all our married life. And why&nbsp;</p>
<p>do you think that was? Because the touch of that girl's fingers was still&nbsp;</p>
<p>there in my body. That's all it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, man, is this embarrassing! Look, I'm sweating! I can't believe I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>saying these things - he "made love' to me, I "came'!" Reiko smiled,&nbsp;</p>
<p>her lips curved again. "But even this didn't help. Two days went by,&nbsp;</p>
<p>three, and her touch was still there. And her last words were echoing&nbsp;</p>
<p>and echoing in my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She didn't come to my house the following Saturday. My heart was&nbsp;</p>
<p>pounding all day long while I waited, wondering what I would do if&nbsp;</p>
<p>she showed up. I couldn't concentrate on anything. She never did&nbsp;</p>
<p>come, though. Of course. She was a proud little thing, and she had&nbsp;</p>
<p>failed with me in the end. She didn't come the next week, either, nor&nbsp;</p>
<p>the week after that, and soon a month went by. I decided that I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>be able to forget about what had happened when enough time had&nbsp;</p>
<p>passed, but I couldn't forget. When I was alone in the house, I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel her presence and my nerves would be on edge. I couldn't play the&nbsp;</p>
<p>piano, I couldn't think, I couldn't do anything during that first month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then one day I realized that something was wrong whenever I left&nbsp;</p>
<p>the house. The neighbours were looking at me in a strange way. There&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a new distance in their eyes. They were as polite as ever with&nbsp;</p>
<p>their greetings, but there was something different in their tone of voice&nbsp;</p>
<p>and in their behaviour towards me. The woman next door, who used to&nbsp;</p>
<p>pay me an occasional visit, seemed to be avoiding me. I tried not to let&nbsp;</p>
<p>these things bother me, though. Start noticing things like that, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>you've got the first signs of illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then one day I had a visit from another housewife I was on friendly&nbsp;</p>
<p>terms with. We were the same age, and she was the daughter of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>friend of my mother's, and her child went to the same kindergarten as&nbsp;</p>
<p>mine, so we were fairly close. She just showed up one day and asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>me if I knew about a terrible rumour that was going around about me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What kind of rumour?' I asked. "I almost can't say it, it's so awful,'&nbsp;</p>
<p>190&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said. "Well, you've got this far, you have to tell me the rest.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Still she resisted telling me, but I finally got it all out of her. I mean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>her whole purpose in coming to see me was to tell me what she had&nbsp;</p>
<p>heard, so of course she was going to spit it out eventually. According&nbsp;</p>
<p>to her, people were saying that I was a card-carrying lesbian and had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been in and out of mental hospitals for it. They said that I had stripped&nbsp;</p>
<p>the clothes off my piano pupil and tried to do things to her and when&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had resisted I had slapped her so hard her face swelled up. They&nbsp;</p>
<p>had turned the story on its head, of course, which was bad enough, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>what really shocked me was that people knew I had been hospitalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My friend said she was telling everyone that she had known me for&nbsp;</p>
<p>ever and that I was not like that, but the girl's parents believed her&nbsp;</p>
<p>version and were spreading it around the neighbourhood. In addition,&nbsp;</p>
<p>they had investigated my background and found that I had a history of&nbsp;</p>
<p>mental problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The way my friend heard it, the girl had come home from her lesson&nbsp;</p>
<p>one day - that day, of course - with her face all bloated, her lip split&nbsp;</p>
<p>and bloody, buttons missing from her blouse, and even her underwear&nbsp;</p>
<p>torn. Can you believe it? She had done all this to back up her story, of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, which her mother had to drag out of her. I can just see her&nbsp;</p>
<p>doing it - putting blood on her blouse, tearing buttons off, ripping the&nbsp;</p>
<p>lace on her bra, making herself cry until her eyes were red, messing up&nbsp;</p>
<p>her hair, telling her mother a pack of lies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not that I'm blaming people for believing her. I would have believed&nbsp;</p>
<p>her, too, this beautiful doll with a devil's tongue. She comes home&nbsp;</p>
<p>crying, she refuses to talk because it's too embarrassing, but then she&nbsp;</p>
<p>spills it out. Of course people are going to believe her. And to make&nbsp;</p>
<p>matters worse, it's true, I do have a history of hospitalization for&nbsp;</p>
<p>mental problems, I did hit her in the face as hard as I could. Who's&nbsp;</p>
<p>going to believe me? Probably just my husband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few more days went by while I wrestled with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>question of whether to tell him or not, but when I did, he believed me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>191&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course. I told him everything that had happened that day - the kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of lesbian things she did to me, the way I slapped her in the face. Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, I didn't tell him what I had felt. I couldn't have told him that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So anyway, he was furious and insisted that he was going to go&nbsp;</p>
<p>straight to the girl's family. He said, "You're a married woman, after&nbsp;</p>
<p>all. You're married to me. And you're a mother. There's no way you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>a lesbian. What a joke!'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I wouldn't let him go. All he could do was make things worse. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew. I knew she was sick. I had seen hundreds of sick people, so I&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew. The girl was rotten inside. Peel off a layer of that beautiful skin,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and you'd find nothing but rotten flesh. I know it's a terrible thing to&nbsp;</p>
<p>say, but it's true. And I knew that ordinary people could never know&nbsp;</p>
<p>the truth about her, that there was no way we could win. She was an&nbsp;</p>
<p>expert at manipulating the emotions of the adults around her, and we&nbsp;</p>
<p>had nothing to prove our case. First of all, who's going to believe that&nbsp;</p>
<p>a 13-year-old girl set a homosexual trap for a woman in her thirties?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what we said, people would believe what they wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>believe. The more we struggled, the more vulnerable we'd be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There was only one thing for us to do, I said: we had to move. If I&nbsp;</p>
<p>stayed in that neighbourhood any longer, the stress would get to me;&nbsp;</p>
<p>my mind would snap again. It was happening already. We had to get&nbsp;</p>
<p>out of there, go somewhere far away where nobody knew me. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>husband wasn't ready to go, though. It hadn't dawned on him yet how&nbsp;</p>
<p>critical I was. And the timing was terrible: he loved his work, and he&nbsp;</p>
<p>had finally succeeded in getting us settled in our own house (we lived&nbsp;</p>
<p>in a little prefab), and our daughter was comfortable in her&nbsp;</p>
<p>kindergarten. "Wait a minute,' he said, "we can't just up sticks and go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find a job just like that. We'd have to sell the house, and we'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to find another kindergarten. It'll take two months at least."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't wait two months,” I told him. "This is going to finish me off&nbsp;</p>
<p>once and for all. I'm not kidding. Believe me, I know what I'm talking&nbsp;</p>
<p>about.' The symptoms were starting already: my ears were ringing,&nbsp;</p>
<p>192&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I was hearing things, and I couldn't sleep. So he suggested that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>leave first, go somewhere by myself, and he would follow after he had&nbsp;</p>
<p>taken care of what had to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""No,' I said, "I don't want to go alone. I'll fall apart if I don't have&nbsp;</p>
<p>you. I need you. Please, don't leave me alone.' He held me and pleaded&nbsp;</p>
<p>with me to hang on a little longer. Just a month, he said. He would&nbsp;</p>
<p>take care of everything - leave his job, sell the house, make&nbsp;</p>
<p>arrangements for kindergarten, find a new job. There might be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>position he could take in Australia, he said. He just wanted me to wait&nbsp;</p>
<p>one month, and everything would be OK. What could I say to that? If&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to object, it would only isolate me even more."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko sighed and looked at the ceiling light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I couldn't hold on for a month, though. One day, it happened again:&nbsp;</p>
<p>snap! And this time it was really bad. I took sleeping pills and turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the gas. I woke up in a hospital bed, and it was all over. It took a&nbsp;</p>
<p>few months before I had calmed down enough to think, and then I&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked my husband for a divorce. I told him it would be the best thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>for him and for our daughter. He said he had no intention of divorcing&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. "We can make a new start,' he said. "We can go somewhere new,&nbsp;</p>
<p>just the three of us, and begin all over again.' "It's too late,' I told him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Everything ended when you asked me to wait a month. If you really&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to start again, you shouldn't have said that to me. Now, no&nbsp;</p>
<p>matter where we go, no matter how far away we move, the same thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>will happen all over again. And I'll ask you for the same thing, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>make you suffer. I don't want to do that any more.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And so we divorced. Or I should say I divorced him. He married&nbsp;</p>
<p>again two years ago, though. I'm still glad I made him leave me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really. I knew I'd be like this for the rest of my life, and I didn't want&nbsp;</p>
<p>to drag anyone down with me. I didn't want to force anyone to live in&nbsp;</p>
<p>constant fear that I might lose my mind at any moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He had been wonderful to me: an ideal husband, faithful, strong and&nbsp;</p>
<p>patient, someone I could put my complete trust in. He had done&nbsp;</p>
<p>193&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything he could to heal me, and I had done everything I could to&nbsp;</p>
<p>be healed, both for his sake and for our daughter's. And I had believed&nbsp;</p>
<p>in my recovery. I was happy for six years from the time we were&nbsp;</p>
<p>married. He got me 99 per cent of the way there, but the other one per&nbsp;</p>
<p>cent went crazy. Snap! Everything we had built up came crashing&nbsp;</p>
<p>down. In one split second, everything turned into nothing. And that&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl was the one who did it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko collected the cigarette butts she had crushed underfoot and&nbsp;</p>
<p>tossed them into the tin can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a terrible story. We worked so hard, so hard, building our world&nbsp;</p>
<p>one brick at a time. And when it fell apart, it happened just like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was gone before you knew it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She stood up and thrust her hands in her pockets. "Let's go back. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>late."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sky was darker, the cloud cover thicker than before, the moon&nbsp;</p>
<p>invisible. Now, I realized, like Reiko I could smell the rain. And with&nbsp;</p>
<p>it mixed the fresh smell of the grapes in the bag I was holding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's why I can't leave this place," she said. "I'm afraid to get&nbsp;</p>
<p>involved with the outside world. I'm afraid to meet new people and&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel new feelings."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I understand," I said. "But I think you can do it. I think you can go&nbsp;</p>
<p>outside and make it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko smiled, but said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko was on the sofa with a book. She had her legs crossed and&nbsp;</p>
<p>pressed her hand against her temple as she read. Her fingers almost&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to be touching and testing each word that entered her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scattered drops of rain were beginning to tap on the roof. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>lamplight enveloped her, hovering around her like fine dust. After my&nbsp;</p>
<p>long talk with Reiko, Naoko's youthfulness struck me in a new way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry we're so late," said Reiko, patting Naoko's head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Enjoy yourselves?" asked Naoko, looking up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>194&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Doing what?" Naoko asked me, - just the two of you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at liberty to say, Miss," I answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko chuckled and set down her book. Then the three of us ate&nbsp;</p>
<p>grapes to the sound of the rain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When it's raining like this," said Naoko, "it feels as if we're the only&nbsp;</p>
<p>ones in the world. I wish it would just keep raining so the three of us&nbsp;</p>
<p>could stay together."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, sure," said Reiko, "and while the two of you are going at it, I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>supposed to be fanning you or playing background music on my guitar&nbsp;</p>
<p>like some dumb geisha? No, thanks!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, I'd let you have him once in a while," said Naoko, laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, then, count me in," said Reiko. "Come on, rain, pour down!"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rain did pour down, and kept pouring. Thunder shook the place&nbsp;</p>
<p>from time to time. When we had finished the grapes, Reiko went back&nbsp;</p>
<p>to her cigarettes and pulled out the guitar from under her bed and&nbsp;</p>
<p>started to play - first, "Desafinado" and "The Girl from Ipanema", then&nbsp;</p>
<p>some Bacharach and a few Lennon and McCartney songs. Reiko and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>sipped wine again, and when that was gone we shared the brandy that&nbsp;</p>
<p>was left in my flask. A warm, intimate mood took hold as the three of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us talked into the night, and I began to wish, with Naoko, that the rain&nbsp;</p>
<p>would keep on falling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Will you come to see me again?" she asked, looking at me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I will," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And will you write?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every week."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And will you add a few lines for me?" asked Reiko. "That I will," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "I'd be glad to."&nbsp;</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, Reiko unfolded the sofa and made a bed for me as&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had the night before. We said goodnight and turned out the lights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unable to sleep, I took The Magic Mountain and a torch from my&nbsp;</p>
<p>rucksack and read for a while. Just before midnight, the bedroom door&nbsp;</p>
<p>edged open and Naoko came and crawled in next to me. Unlike the&nbsp;</p>
<p>195&nbsp;</p>
<p>night before, Naoko was the usual Naoko. Her eyes were in focus, her&nbsp;</p>
<p>movements brisk. Bringing her mouth to my ear, she whispered, "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't know, I can't sleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't either," I said. Setting my book down and turning out the&nbsp;</p>
<p>torch, I took her in my arms and kissed her. The darkness and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sound of the rain enfolded us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about Reiko?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry, she's sound asleep. And when she sleeps, she sleeps."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Naoko asked, "Will you really come to see me again?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I will."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Even if I can't do anything for you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded in the darkness. I could feel the full shape of her breasts&nbsp;</p>
<p>against me. I traced the outline of her body through her gown with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>flat of my hand. From shoulder to back to hips, I ran my hand over her&nbsp;</p>
<p>again and again, driving the line and the softness of her body into my&nbsp;</p>
<p>brain. After we had been in this gentle embrace for a while, Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>touched her lips to my forehead and slipped out of bed. I could see her&nbsp;</p>
<p>pale blue gown flash in the darkness like a fish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Goodbye," she called in a tiny voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listening to the rain, I dropped into a gentle sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was still raining the following morning - a fine, almost invisible&nbsp;</p>
<p>autumn rain unlike the previous night's downpour. You knew it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>raining only because of the ripples on puddles and the sound of&nbsp;</p>
<p>dripping from the eaves. I woke to see a milky white mist enclosing&nbsp;</p>
<p>the window, but as the sun rose a breeze carried the mist away, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the surrounding woods and hills began to emerge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we had done the day before, the three of us ate breakfast then went&nbsp;</p>
<p>out to attend to the aviary. Naoko and Reiko wore yellow plastic&nbsp;</p>
<p>raincapes with hoods. I put on a jumper and a waterproof windcheater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside the air was damp and chilly. The birds, too, were avoiding the&nbsp;</p>
<p>rain, huddled together at the back of the cage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>196&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Gets cold here when it rains, doesn't it?" I said to Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every time it rains it'll be a little colder now, until it turns to snow,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said. "The clouds from the Sea of Japan dump tons of snow when&nbsp;</p>
<p>they pass through here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you do with the birds in the winter?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Bring them inside, of course. What are we supposed to do - dig them&nbsp;</p>
<p>out of the snow in spring all frozen? We defrost 'em and bring 'em&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to life and yell, OK, everybody, come and get it!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I poked the wire mesh and the parrot flapped its wings and squawked&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Shithead!" "Thank you!" "Crazy!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now, that one I'd like to freeze," Naoko said with a melancholy look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really think I will go crazy if I have to hear that every morning."&nbsp;</p>
<p>After cleaning the aviary, we went back to the flat. While I packed my&nbsp;</p>
<p>things, the women put on their farm clothes. We left the building&nbsp;</p>
<p>together and parted just beyond the tennis court. They turned right and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I continued straight ahead. We called goodbye to each other, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>promised I would come again. Naoko gave a little smile and&nbsp;</p>
<p>disappeared around a corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my way to the gate I passed several people, all wearing the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>yellow raincapes that Naoko and Reiko wore, all with their hoods up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colours shone with an exceptional clarity in the rain: the ground was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>deep black, the pine branches a brilliant green, and the people&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrapped in yellow looking like otherworldly spirits that were only&nbsp;</p>
<p>allowed to wander the earth on rainy mornings. They floated over the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ground in silence, carrying farm tools, baskets and sacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatekeeper remembered my name and marked it on the list of&nbsp;</p>
<p>visitors as I left. "I see you're here from Tokyo," the old fellow said. "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>went there once. Just once. They serve great pork."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They do?" I asked, uncertain how to answer him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I didn't like much of what I ate in Tokyo, but the pork was delicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect they have some special way of rearing 'em, eh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I didn't know, it was the first I'd heard of it. "When was&nbsp; that, by&nbsp;</p>
<p>197&nbsp;</p>
<p>the way, when you went to Tokyo?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm, let's see," he said, cocking his head, "was it the time His&nbsp;</p>
<p>Majesty the Crown prince got married? My son was in Tokyo and said&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ought to see the place at least once. That must have been 1959."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, well then, sure, pork must have been good in Tokyo back then," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about these days?" he asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wasn't sure, I said, but I hadn't heard anything special about it. This&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to disappoint him. He gave every sign of wanting to continue&nbsp;</p>
<p>our conversation, but I told him I had to catch a bus and started&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking in the direction of the road. Patches of fog remained floating&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the path where it skirted the stream, but the breeze carried them&nbsp;</p>
<p>over to the steep flanks of a nearby mountain. Every now and then as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>walked along I would stop, turn, and heave a deep sigh for no&nbsp;</p>
<p>particular reason. I felt as though I had arrived on a planet where the&nbsp;</p>
<p>gravity was a little different. Yes, of course, I told myself, feeling sad:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in the outside world now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back at the dorm by 4.30, I changed straight away and left for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>record shop in Shinjuku to put in my hours. I looked after the shop&nbsp;</p>
<p>from six o'clock to 10.30 and sold a few records, but mainly I sat there&nbsp;</p>
<p>in a daze, watching an incredible variety of people streaming by&nbsp;</p>
<p>outside. There were families and couples and drunks and gangsters&nbsp;</p>
<p>and lively-looking girls in short skirts and bearded hippies and bar&nbsp;</p>
<p>hostesses and some indefinable types. Whenever I put on hard rock,&nbsp;</p>
<p>hippies and runaway kids would gather outside to dance and sniff&nbsp;</p>
<p>paint thinner or just sit on the ground doing nothing in particular, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I put on Tony Bennett, they would disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next door was a shop where a middle-aged, sleepy-eyed man sold&nbsp;</p>
<p>"adult toys". I couldn't imagine why anyone would want the kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>sex paraphernalia he had there, but he seemed to do a roaring trade. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>the alley diagonally across from the record shop I saw a drunken&nbsp;</p>
<p>student vomiting. In the game arcade across from us at another angle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>198&nbsp;</p>
<p>the cook from a local restaurant was killing time on his break with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>game of bingo that took cash bets. Beneath the eaves of a shop that&nbsp;</p>
<p>had closed for the night, a swarthy homeless guy was crouching,&nbsp;</p>
<p>motionless. A girl with pale pink lipstick who couldn't have been more&nbsp;</p>
<p>than 12 or 13 came in and asked me to play the Rolling Stones'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Jumpin' Jack Flash". When I found the record and put it on for her,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she started snapping her fingers to the rhythm and shaking her hips as&nbsp;</p>
<p>she danced around the shop. Then she asked me for a cigarette. I gave&nbsp;</p>
<p>her one of the manager's, which she smoked gratefully, and when the&nbsp;</p>
<p>record ended she left the shop without so much as a "thank you".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every 15 minutes or so I would hear the siren of an ambulance or&nbsp;</p>
<p>police car. Three drunk company executives in suits and ties came by,&nbsp;</p>
<p>laughing at the top of their voices every time they yelled "Nice arse!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>at a pretty, long-haired girl in a phone box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more I watched, the more confused I became. What the hell was&nbsp;</p>
<p>this all about? I wondered. What could it possibly mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manager came back from dinner and said to me, "Hey, know&nbsp;</p>
<p>what, Watanabe? Night before last I made it with the boutique chick."&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some time now he had had his eye on the girl who worked at a&nbsp;</p>
<p>boutique nearby, and every once in a while he would take a record&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the shop as a gift for her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good for you," I said to him, whereupon he told me every last detail&nbsp;</p>
<p>of his conquest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you really wanna make a chick, here's what ya gotta do,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>he began, very pleased with himself. "First, ya gotta give 'er presents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then ya gotta get 'er drunk. I mean really drunk. Then ya just gotta do&nbsp;</p>
<p>it. It's easy. See what I mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head mixed up as ever, I boarded the commuter train and went back&nbsp;</p>
<p>to my dorm. Closing the curtains, I turned off the lights, stretched out&nbsp;</p>
<p>in bed, and felt as if Naoko might come crawling in beside me at any&nbsp;</p>
<p>moment. With my eyes closed, I could feel the soft swell of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>breasts on my chest, hear her whispering to me, and feel the outline of&nbsp;</p>
<p>199&nbsp;</p>
<p>her body in my hands. In the darkness, I returned to that small world&nbsp;</p>
<p>of hers. I smelled the meadow grass, heard the rain at night. I thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>of her naked, as I had seen her in the moonlight, and pictured her&nbsp;</p>
<p>cleaning the aviary and tending to the vegetables with that soft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful body of hers wrapped in the yellow raincape. Clutching my&nbsp;</p>
<p>erection, I thought of Naoko until I came. This seemed to clear my&nbsp;</p>
<p>brain a little, but it didn't help me sleep. I felt exhausted, desperate for&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleep, but it simply refused to cooperate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got out of bed and stood at the window, my unfocused eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>wandering out towards the flagpole. Without the national flag attached&nbsp;</p>
<p>to it, the pole looked like a gigantic white bone thrusting up into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness of night. What was Naoko doing now? I wondered. Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, she must be sleeping, sleeping deeply, shrouded in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness of that curious little world of hers. Let her be spared from&nbsp;</p>
<p>anguished dreams, I found myself hoping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>200&nbsp;</p>
<p>In P.E. class the next morning, Thursday, I swam several lengths of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the 50-metre pool. The vigorous exercise cleared my head some more&nbsp;</p>
<p>and gave me an appetite. After eating a good-sized lunch at a student&nbsp;</p>
<p>restaurant known for its good-sized lunches, I was on my way to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>literature department library to do some research when I bumped into&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori Kobayashi. She had someone with her, a petite girl with&nbsp;</p>
<p>glasses, but when she spotted me, she approached me alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where you going?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lit. library," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why don't you forget it and come have lunch with me?" "I've already&nbsp;</p>
<p>eaten."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what? Eat again."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ended up going to a nearby café where she had a plate of curry&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I had a cup of coffee. She wore a white, longsleeved shirt under a&nbsp;</p>
<p>yellow woollen vest with a fish knitted into the design, a narrow gold&nbsp;</p>
<p>necklace, and a Disney watch. She seemed to enjoy the curry and&nbsp;</p>
<p>drank three glasses of water with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where've you been?" Midori asked. "I don't know how many times I&nbsp;</p>
<p>called."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Was there something you wanted to talk about?" "Nothing special. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>just called."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I see."&nbsp;</p>
<p>201&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You see what?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing. Just "I see'," I said. "Any fires lately?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That was fun, wasn't it? It didn't do much damage, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>that smoke made it feel real. Great stuff." Midori gulped another glass&nbsp;</p>
<p>of water, took a breath and studied my face for a while. "Hey, what's&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrong with you?" she asked. "You've got this spaced-out face. Your&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes aren't focused."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm OK," I said. "I just came back from a trip and I'm tired."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You look like you've just seen a ghost." "I see."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, do you have "German and R.E. "Can you skip 'en: "Not&nbsp;</p>
<p>German. I've "When's it over?" "Two."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK. How about going into the city with me after that some drinks?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At two in the afternoon?!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For a change, why not? You look so spaced. Come on, come drinking&nbsp;</p>
<p>with me and get a little life into you. That's what I want to do - drink&nbsp;</p>
<p>with you and get some life into myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you say?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, let's go," I said with a sigh. "I'll look for you in the Lit. quad at&nbsp;</p>
<p>two."&nbsp;</p>
<p>After German we caught a bus to Shinjuku and went to an&nbsp;</p>
<p>underground bar called DUG behind the Kinokuniya bookshop. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>each started with two vodka and tonics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I come here once in a while," she said. "They don't make you feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>embarrassed to be drinking in the afternoon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you drink in the afternoon a lot?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sometimes," she said, rattling the ice in her glass. "Sometimes, when&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world gets too hard to live in, I come here for a vodka and tonic."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does the world get hard to live in?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sometimes," said Midori. "I've got my own special little problems."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like what?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like family, like boyfriends, like irregular periods. Stuff." "So have&nbsp;</p>
<p>another drink."&nbsp;</p>
<p>202&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I will."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I beckoned to the waiter and ordered two more vodka and tonics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Remember how, when you came over that Sunday, you kissed me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori asked. "I've been thinking about it. It was nice. Really nice."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's nice."&nbsp;</p>
<p>""That's nice'," she mimicked. "The way you talk is so weird!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, I was thinking, that time. I was thinking how great it would&nbsp;</p>
<p>be if that had been the first time in my life a boy had kissed me. If I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could switch around the order of my life, I would absolutely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>absolutely make that my first kiss. And then I would live the rest of&nbsp;</p>
<p>my life thinking stuff like: Hey, I wonder whatever happened to that&nbsp;</p>
<p>boy named Watanabe I gave my first kiss to on the laundry deck, now&nbsp;</p>
<p>that he's 58? Wouldn't that be great?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, really," I said, cracking a pistachio nut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, what is it with you? Why are you so spaced out? You still&nbsp;</p>
<p>haven't answered me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I probably still haven't completely adapted to the world.' I said after&nbsp;</p>
<p>giving it some thought. "I don't know, I feel like this isn't the real&nbsp;</p>
<p>world. The people, the scene: they just don't seem real to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori rested an elbow on the bar and looked at me. "There was&nbsp;</p>
<p>something like that in a Jim Morrison song, I'm pretty sure."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"People are strange when you're a stranger."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace," said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peace," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You really ought to go to Uruguay with me," Midori said, still&nbsp;</p>
<p>leaning on the bar. "Girlfriend, family, university - just dump 'em all."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not a bad idea," I said, laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't you think it would be wonderful to get rid of everything and&nbsp;</p>
<p>everybody and just go somewhere where you don't know a soul?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like doing that. I really, really want to do it&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes. Like, suppose you whisked me somewhere far, far away,&nbsp;</p>
<p>203&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd make lots of babies for you as tough as little bulls. And we'd all&nbsp;</p>
<p>live happily ever after, rolling on the floor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I laughed and drank my third vodka and tonic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess you don't really want lots of babies as tough as little bulls&nbsp;</p>
<p>yet," said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm intrigued," I said. "I'd like to see what they look like."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK, you don't have to want them," said Midori, eating a&nbsp;</p>
<p>pistachio. "Here I am, drinking in the afternoon, saying whatever pops&nbsp;</p>
<p>into my head: "I wanna dump everything and run off somewhere.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the point of going to Uruguay? All they've got there is donkey&nbsp;</p>
<p>shit."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You may be right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Donkey shit everywhere. Here a shit, there a shit, the whole world is&nbsp;</p>
<p>donkey shit. Hey, I can't open this. You take it." Midori handed me a&nbsp;</p>
<p>pistachio nut. I struggled with it until I cracked it open. "But oh, what&nbsp;</p>
<p>a relief it was last Sunday! Going up to the laundry deck with you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>watching the fire, drinking beer, singing songs. I don't know how long&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's been since I had such a total sense of relief. People are always&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to force stuff on me. The minute they see me they start telling&nbsp;</p>
<p>me what to do. At least you don't try to force stuff on me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know you well enough to force stuff on you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean, if you knew me better, you'd force stuff on me like&nbsp;</p>
<p>everyone else?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's possible," I said. "That's how people live in the real world:&nbsp;</p>
<p>forcing stuff on each other."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You wouldn't do that. I can tell. I'm an expert when it comes to&nbsp;</p>
<p>forcing stuff and having stuff forced on you. You're not the type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why I can relax with you. Do you have any idea how many&nbsp;</p>
<p>people there are in the world who like to force stuff on people and&nbsp;</p>
<p>have stuff forced on them? Tons! And then they make a big fuss, like&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I forced her', "You forced me!' That's what they like. But I don't like&nbsp;</p>
<p>it. I just do it because I have to."&nbsp;</p>
<p>204&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What kind of stuff do you force on people or they force on you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori put an ice-cube in her mouth and sucked on it for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you want to get to know me better?" she asked. "Yeah, kind of."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, look, I just asked you, "Do you want to get to know me better?'&nbsp;</p>
<p>What sort of answer is that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, Midori, I would like to get to know you better," I said. "Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Even if you had to turn your eyes away from what you saw?&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Are you that bad?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, in a way," Midori said with a frown. "I want another drink."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called the waiter and ordered a fourth round of drinks. Until they&nbsp;</p>
<p>came, Midori cupped her chin in her hand with her elbow on the bar. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>kept quiet and listened to Thelonious Monk playing "Honeysuckle&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose". There were five or six other customers in the place, but we&nbsp;</p>
<p>were the only ones drinking alcohol. The rich smell of coffee gave the&nbsp;</p>
<p>gloomy interior an intimate atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you free this Sunday?" Midori asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think I told you before, I'm always free on Sunday. Until I go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>work at six."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, then, this Sunday, will you hang out with me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll pick you up at your dorm Sunday morning. I'm not sure exactly&nbsp;</p>
<p>what time, though. Is that OK?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," I said. "No problem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now, let me ask you: do you have any idea what I would like to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>right now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't imagine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, first of all, I want to lie down in a big, wide, fluffy bed. I want&nbsp;</p>
<p>to get all comfy and drunk and not have any donkey shit anywhere&nbsp;</p>
<p>nearby, and I want to have you lying down next to me. And then, little&nbsp;</p>
<p>by little, you take off my clothes. Sooo tenderly. The way a mother&nbsp;</p>
<p>undresses a little child. Sooo softly."&nbsp;</p>
<p>205&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm ..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I'm just spacing out and feeling really nice until, all of a sudden&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize what's happening and I yell at you "Stop it, Watanabe!' And&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I say "I really like you, Watanabe, but I'm seeing someone else. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can't do this. I'm very proper about these things, believe it or not, so&nbsp;</p>
<p>please stop.' But you&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't stop."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I would stop," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know that. Never mind, this is just my fantasy," said Midori. "So&nbsp;</p>
<p>then you show it to me. Your thing. Sticking right up. I immediately&nbsp;</p>
<p>cover my eyes, of course, but I can't help seeing it for a split second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I say, "Stop it! Don't do that! I don't want anything so big and&nbsp;</p>
<p>hard!"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's not so big. Just ordinary."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never mind, this is a fantasy. So then you put on this really sad face,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I feel sorry for you and try to comfort you. There there, poor&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you're telling me that's what you want to do now?" "That's it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh boy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We left the bar after five rounds of vodka and tonic. When I tried to&nbsp;</p>
<p>pay, Midori slapped my hand and paid with a brand-new #10,000 note&nbsp;</p>
<p>she took from her purse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's OK," she said. "I just got paid, and I invited you. Of course, if&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're a card-carrying fascist and you refuse to let a woman buy you a&nbsp;</p>
<p>drink. .."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No no, I'm OK."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I didn't let you put it in, either." "Because it's so big and hard," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right," said Midori. "Because it's so big and hard."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little drunk, Midori missed one step, and we almost fell back down&nbsp;</p>
<p>the stairs. The layer of clouds that had darkened the sky was gone&nbsp;</p>
<p>206&nbsp;</p>
<p>now, and the late afternoon sun poured its gentle light on the city&nbsp;</p>
<p>streets. Midori and I wandered around for a while. She said she&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to climb a tree, but unfortunately there were no climbable trees&nbsp;</p>
<p>in Shinjuku, and the Shinjuku Imperial Gardens were closing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Too bad," said Midori. "I love climbing trees."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continued walking and window-shopping, and soon the street&nbsp;</p>
<p>scene seemed more real to me than it had before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm glad I ran into you," I said. "I think I'm a little more adapted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori stopped short and peered at me. "It's true," she said. "Your&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes are much more in focus than they were. See? Hanging out with&nbsp;</p>
<p>me does you good."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No doubt about it," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 5.30 Midori said she had to go home and make dinner. I said I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would take a bus back to my dorm, and saw her as far as the station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Know what I want to do now?" Midori asked me as she was leaving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have absolutely no idea what you could be thinking," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I want you and me to be captured by pirates. Then they strip us and&nbsp;</p>
<p>press us together face to face all naked and wind these ropes around&nbsp;</p>
<p>us."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why would they do a thing like that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Perverted pirates," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're the perverted one," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So then they lock us in the hold and say, "In one hour, we're gonna&nbsp;</p>
<p>throw you into the sea, so have a good time&nbsp;</p>
<p>until then'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And ... ?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So we enjoy ourselves for an hour, rolling all over the place and&nbsp;</p>
<p>twisting our bodies."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And that's the main thing you want to do now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh boy," I said, shaking my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>207&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori came for me at 9.30 on Sunday morning. I had just woken up&nbsp;</p>
<p>and hadn't washed my face. Somebody pounded on my door, yelling&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, it's a woman!" I went down to the lobby to find&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori sitting there with her legs crossed wearing an incredibly short&nbsp;</p>
<p>denim skirt, yawning. Every student passing by on his way to&nbsp;</p>
<p>breakfast slowed down to stare at her long, slim legs. She did have&nbsp;</p>
<p>really nice legs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Am I too early?" she asked. "I bet you just woke up."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Can you give me 15 minutes? I'll wash my face and shave." "I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>mind waiting, but all these guys are staring at&nbsp;</p>
<p>my legs."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What d'you expect, coming into a men's dorm in such a short skirt?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course they're going to stare."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, well, it's OK. I'm wearing really cute panties today - all pink and&nbsp;</p>
<p>frilly and lacy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That just makes it worse," I said with a sigh. I went back to my room&nbsp;</p>
<p>and washed and shaved as fast as I could, put on a blue button-down&nbsp;</p>
<p>shirt and a grey tweed sports coat, then went back down and ushered&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori out through the dorm gate. I was in a cold sweat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, Watanabe," Midori said, looking up at the dorm buildings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"do all the guys in here wank - rub-a-dub-dub?" "Probably," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do guys think about girls when they do that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose so. I kind of doubt that anyone thinks about the stock&nbsp;</p>
<p>market or verb conjugations or the Suez Canal when they wank. Nope,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure just about everybody thinks about girls."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Suez Canal?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For example."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So I suppose they think about particular girls, right?" "Shouldn't you&nbsp;</p>
<p>be asking your boyfriend about that?" I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "Why should I have to explain stuff like this to you on a Sunday&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>208&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was just curious," she said. "Besides, he'd get angry if I asked him&nbsp;</p>
<p>about stuff like that. He'd say girls aren't supposed to ask all those&nbsp;</p>
<p>questions."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A perfectly normal point of view, I'd say."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I want to know. This is pure curiosity. Do guys think about&nbsp;</p>
<p>particular girls when they wank?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave up trying to avoid the question. "Well, I do at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know about anybody else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Have you ever thought about me while you were doing it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell me the truth. I won't be angry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I haven't, to tell the truth," I answered honestly. "Why not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aren't I attractive enough?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, you're attractive, all right. You're cute, and sexy outfits look&nbsp;</p>
<p>great on you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So why don't you think about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, first of all, I think of you as a friend, so I don't want to involve&nbsp;</p>
<p>you in my sexual fantasies, and second - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You've got somebody else you're supposed to be thinking about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's about the size of it," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have good manners even when it comes to something like this,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori said. "That's what I like about you. Still, couldn't you allow me&nbsp;</p>
<p>just one brief appearance? I want to be in one of your sexual fantasies&nbsp;</p>
<p>or daydreams or whatever you call them. I'm asking you because we're&nbsp;</p>
<p>friends. Who else can I ask for something like that? I can't just walk&nbsp;</p>
<p>up to anyone and say, "When you wank tonight, will you please think&nbsp;</p>
<p>of me for a second?' It's because I think of you as a friend that I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>asking. And I want you to tell me later what it was like. You know,&nbsp;</p>
<p>what you did and stuff."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I let out a sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't put it in, though. Because we're just friends. Right? As&nbsp;</p>
<p>long as you don't put it in, you can do anything you like, think&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything you want."&nbsp;</p>
<p>209&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, I've never done it with so many restrictions before," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Will you just think about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All right, I'll think about you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, Watanabe, I don't want you to get the wrong impression -&nbsp;</p>
<p>that I'm a nymphomaniac or frustrated or a tease or anything. I'm just&nbsp;</p>
<p>interested in that stuff. I want to know about it. I grew up surrounded&nbsp;</p>
<p>by nothing but girls in a girls' school, you know that. I want to find out&nbsp;</p>
<p>what guys are thinking and how their bodies are put together. And not&nbsp;</p>
<p>just from pull-out sections in the women's magazines but actual case&nbsp;</p>
<p>studies."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Case studies?" I groaned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But my boyfriend doesn't like it when I want to know things or try&nbsp;</p>
<p>things. He gets angry, calls me a nympho or crazy. He won't even let&nbsp;</p>
<p>me give him a blow job. Now, that's one thing I'm dying to study."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you hate getting blow jobs?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, not really, I don't hate it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Would you say you like it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'd say that. But can we talk about this next time? Here it is, a&nbsp;</p>
<p>really nice Sunday morning, and I don't want to ruin it talking about&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanking and blow jobs. Let's talk about something else. Is your&nbsp;</p>
<p>boyfriend at the same university as us?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nope, he goes to another one, of course. We met at school during a&nbsp;</p>
<p>club activity. I was in the girls' school, he was in the boys', and you&nbsp;</p>
<p>know how they do those things, joint concerts and stuff. We got&nbsp;</p>
<p>serious after our exams, though. Hey, Watanabe."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You only have to do it once. Just think about me, OK?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, I'll give it a try, next time," I said, throwing in the towel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took a commuter train to Ochanomizu. When we transferred at&nbsp;</p>
<p>210&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shinjuku I bought a thin sandwich at a stand in the station to make up&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the breakfast I hadn't eaten. The coffee I had with it tasted like&nbsp;</p>
<p>boiled printer's ink. The Sunday morning trains were filled with&nbsp;</p>
<p>couples and families on outings. A group of boys with baseball bats&nbsp;</p>
<p>and matching uniforms scampered around inside the carriage. Several&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the girls on the train had short skirts on, but none as short as&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's. Midori would pull on hers every now and then as it rode up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the men stared at her thighs, which made me feel uneasy, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>she didn't seem to mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Know what I'd like to do right now?" she whispered when we had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been travelling a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No idea," I said. "But please, don't talk about that stuff here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somebody'll hear you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Too bad. This one's kind of wild," Midori said with obvious&nbsp;</p>
<p>disappointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Anyway, why are we going to Ochanomizu?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just come along, you'll see."&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the cram schools around Ochanomizu Station, on Sunday the&nbsp;</p>
<p>area was full of school kids on their way to classes or exam practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori barged through the crowds clutching the strap of her shoulder&nbsp;</p>
<p>bag with one hand and my hand with the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without warning, she asked me, "Hey, Watanabe, can you explain the&nbsp;</p>
<p>difference between t</p>
<p>&nbsp;he English present subjunctive and past&nbsp;</p>
<p>subjunctive?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think I can," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let me ask you, then, what possible use is stuff like that for everyday&nbsp;</p>
<p>life?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"None at all," I said. "It may not serve any concrete purpose, but it&nbsp;</p>
<p>does give you some kind of training to help you grasp things in&nbsp;</p>
<p>general more systematically."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori gave that a moment's serious thought. "You're amazing," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "That never occurred to me before. I always thought of things&nbsp;</p>
<p>211&nbsp;</p>
<p>like the subjunctive case and differential calculus and chemical&nbsp;</p>
<p>symbols as totally useless. A pain in the neck. So I've always ignored&nbsp;</p>
<p>them. Now I have to wonder if my whole life has been a mistake."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You've ignored them?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. Like, for me, they didn't exist. I don't have the slightest idea&nbsp;</p>
<p>what "sine' and "cosine' mean."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's incredible! How did you pass your exams? How did you get&nbsp;</p>
<p>into university?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be silly," said Midori. "You don't have to know anything to&nbsp;</p>
<p>pass entrance exams! All you need is a little intuition - and I have&nbsp;</p>
<p>great intuition. "Choose the correct answer from the following three.' I&nbsp;</p>
<p>know immediately which one is right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My intuition's not as good as yours, so I have to be systematic to&nbsp;</p>
<p>some extent. Like the way a magpie collects bits of glass in a hollow&nbsp;</p>
<p>tree."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does it serve some purpose?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder. It probably makes it easier to do some things." "What kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of things? Give me an example." "Metaphysical thought, say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastering several languages." "What good does that do?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It depends on the person who does it. It serves a purpose for some,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and not for others. But mainly it's training. Whether&nbsp;</p>
<p>it serves a purpose or not is another question. Like I said." "Hmm,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>said Midori, seemingly impressed. She led me by&nbsp;</p>
<p>the hand down the hill. "You know, Watanabe, you're really&nbsp;</p>
<p>good at explaining things to people."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true. I've asked hundreds of people what use the&nbsp;</p>
<p>English subjunctive is, and not one of them gave me a good,&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear answer like yours. Not even English teachers. They either&nbsp;</p>
<p>got confused or angry or laughed it off. Nobody ever gave me&nbsp;</p>
<p>a decent answer. If somebody like you had been around when&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked my question, and had given me a proper explanation,&nbsp;</p>
<p>212&nbsp;</p>
<p>even I might have been interested in the subjunctive. Damn!" "Hmm,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Have you ever read Das Kapital?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. Not the whole thing, of course, but parts, like most&nbsp;</p>
<p>people."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Did you understand it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I understood some bits, not others. You have to acquire the&nbsp;</p>
<p>necessary intellectual apparatus to read a book like Das Kapital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I understand the general idea of Marxism, though." "Do you&nbsp;</p>
<p>think a first-year student who hasn't read books&nbsp;</p>
<p>like that can understand Das Kapital just by reading it?" "That's pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>nigh impossible, I'd say."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, when I went to university I joined a folk-music&nbsp;</p>
<p>club. I just wanted to sing songs. But the members were a load of&nbsp;</p>
<p>frauds. I get goose-bumps just thinking about them. The first thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>they tell you when you enter the club is you have to read Marx. "Read&nbsp;</p>
<p>page so-and-so to such-and-such for next time.' Somebody gave a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lecture on how folk songs have to be deeply involved with society and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the radical movement. So, what the hell, I went home and tried as hard&nbsp;</p>
<p>as I could to read it, but I didn't understand a thing. It was worse than&nbsp;</p>
<p>the subjunctive. I gave up after three pages. So I went to the next&nbsp;</p>
<p>week's meeting like a good little scout and said I had read it, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't understand it. From that point on they treated me like an idiot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no critical awareness of the class struggle, they said, I was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>social cripple. I mean, this was serious. And all because I said I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't understand a piece of writing. Don't you think they were&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-huh," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And their so-called discussions were terrible, too. Everybody would&nbsp;</p>
<p>use big words and pretend they knew what was going on. But I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>ask questions whenever I didn't understand something. "What is this&nbsp;</p>
<p>imperialist exploitation stuff you're talking about? Is it connected&nbsp;</p>
<p>213&nbsp;</p>
<p>somehow to the East India Company?' "Does smashing the&nbsp;</p>
<p>educational-industrial complex mean we're not supposed to work for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>company after we graduate?' And stuff like that. But nobody was&nbsp;</p>
<p>willing to explain anything to me. Far from it - they got really angry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you believe it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"One guy yelled at me, "You stupid bitch, how do you live like that&nbsp;</p>
<p>with nothing in your brain?' Well, that did it. I wasn't going to put up&nbsp;</p>
<p>with that. OK, so I'm not so smart. I'm working class. But it's the&nbsp;</p>
<p>working class that keeps the world running, and it's the working&nbsp;</p>
<p>classes that get exploited. What kind of revolution is it that just throws&nbsp;</p>
<p>out big words that working-class people can't understand? What kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of crap social revolution is that? I mean, I'd like to make the world a&nbsp;</p>
<p>better place, too. If somebody's really being exploited, we've got to&nbsp;</p>
<p>put a stop to it. That's what I believe, and that's why I ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I right, or what?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So that's when it hit me. These guys are fakes. All they've got on&nbsp;</p>
<p>their minds is impressing the new girls with the big words they're so&nbsp;</p>
<p>proud of, while sticking their hands up their skirts. And when they&nbsp;</p>
<p>graduate, they cut their hair short and march off to work for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitsubishi or IBM or Fuji Bank. They marry pretty wives who've&nbsp;</p>
<p>never read Marx and have kids they give fancy new names to that are&nbsp;</p>
<p>enough to make you puke. Smash what educational-industrial&nbsp;</p>
<p>complex? Don't make me laugh! And the new members were just as&nbsp;</p>
<p>bad. They didn't understand a thing either, but they pretended to and&nbsp;</p>
<p>they were laughing at me. After the meeting, they told me, "Don't be&nbsp;</p>
<p>silly! So what if you don't understand? Just agree with everything they&nbsp;</p>
<p>say.' Hey, Watanabe, I've got stuff that made me even madder than&nbsp;</p>
<p>that. Wanna hear it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure, why not?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, one time they called a late-night political meeting, and they&nbsp;</p>
<p>214&nbsp;</p>
<p>told each girl to make 20 rice balls for midnight snacks. I mean, talk&nbsp;</p>
<p>about sex discrimination! I decided to keep quiet for a change, though,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and showed up like a good girl with my 20 rice balls, complete with&nbsp;</p>
<p>umeboshi inside and nori outside. And what do you think I got for my&nbsp;</p>
<p>efforts? Afterwards people complained because my rice balls had only&nbsp;</p>
<p>umeboshi inside, and I hadn't brought anything along to go with them!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other girls stuffed theirs with cod roe and salmon, and they&nbsp;</p>
<p>included nice, thick slices of fried egg. I got so furious I couldn't talk!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who the hell do these ,revolution'-mongers think they are making a&nbsp;</p>
<p>fuss over rice balls? They should be grateful for umeboshi and nori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of the children starving in India!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I laughed. "So then what happened with your club?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I left in June, I was so furious," Midori said. "Most of these student&nbsp;</p>
<p>types are total frauds. They're scared to death somebody's gonna find&nbsp;</p>
<p>out they don't know something. They all read the same books and they&nbsp;</p>
<p>all spout the same slogans, and they love listening to John Coltrane&nbsp;</p>
<p>and seeing Pasolini movies. You call that "revolution?"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, don't ask me, I've never actually seen a revolution." "Well, if&nbsp;</p>
<p>that's revolution, you can stick it. They'd probably shoot me for&nbsp;</p>
<p>putting umeboshi in my rice balls. They'd shoot you, too, for&nbsp;</p>
<p>understanding the subjunctive." "It could happen."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm working class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revolution or not, the working class will just keep on scraping a&nbsp;</p>
<p>living in the same old shitholes. And what is a revolution? It sure as&nbsp;</p>
<p>hell isn't just changing the name on city hall. But those guys don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>know that - those guys with their big words. Tell me, Watanabe, have&nbsp;</p>
<p>you ever seen a taxman?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well I have. Lots of times. They come barging in and acting big.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's this ledger for?' "Hey, you keep pretty sloppy records.' "You&nbsp;</p>
<p>call this a business expense?' "I want to see all your receipts right&nbsp;</p>
<p>now.' Meanwhile, we're crouching in the corner, and when suppertime&nbsp;</p>
<p>215&nbsp;</p>
<p>comes we have to treat them to sushi deluxe - home delivered. Let me&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell you, though, my father never once cheated on his taxes. That's just&nbsp;</p>
<p>how he is, a real old-fashioned straight arrow. But tell that to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>taxman. All he can do is dig and dig and dig and dig. "Income's a little&nbsp;</p>
<p>low here, don't you think?' Well, of course the income's low when&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're not making any money! I wanted to scream: "Go do this where&nbsp;</p>
<p>they've got some money!' Do you think the taxman's attitude would&nbsp;</p>
<p>change if there was a revolution?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Highly doubtful, highly doubtful."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That does it, then. I'm not going to believe in any damned revolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love is all I'm going to believe in."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace," said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, where are we going?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The hospital," she said. "My father's there. It's my turn to stay with&nbsp;</p>
<p>him all day."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your father?! I thought he was in Uruguay!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That was a lie," said Midori in a matter-of-fact tone. "He's been&nbsp;</p>
<p>screaming about going to Uruguay forever, but he could never do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He can hardly get himself out of Tokyo."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How bad is he?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's just a matter of time," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We walked on in silence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know what I'm talking about. It's the same thing my mother had. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>brain tumour. Can you believe it? It's hardly been two years since she&nbsp;</p>
<p>died of a brain tumour, and now he's got one."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University Hospital corridors were noisy and crowded with&nbsp;</p>
<p>weekend visitors and patients who had less serious symptoms, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>everywhere hung that special hospital smell, a cloud of disinfectant&nbsp;</p>
<p>and visitors' bouquets, and urine and mattresses, while nurses surged&nbsp;</p>
<p>back and forth with a dry clattering of heels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's father was in a semi-private room in the bed nearest the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>216&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stretched out, he looked like some tiny creature with a fatal wound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He lay on his side, limp, the drooping left arm inert, jabbed with an&nbsp;</p>
<p>intravenous needle. He was a small, skinny man who gave the&nbsp;</p>
<p>impression that he would only get smaller and thinner. A white&nbsp;</p>
<p>bandage encircled his head, and his pasty white arms were dotted with&nbsp;</p>
<p>the holes left by injections or intravenous drips. His half-open eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>stared at a fixed point in space, bloodshot spheres that twitched in our&nbsp;</p>
<p>direction when we entered the room. For some ten seconds they stayed&nbsp;</p>
<p>focused on us, then drifted back to that fixed point in space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You knew when you saw those eyes he was going to die soon. There&nbsp;</p>
<p>was no sign of life in his flesh, just the barest trace of what had once&nbsp;</p>
<p>been a life. His body was like a dilapidated old house from which all&nbsp;</p>
<p>the fixtures and fittings have been removed, awaiting its final&nbsp;</p>
<p>demolition. Around the dry lips clumps of whiskers sprouted like&nbsp;</p>
<p>weeds. So, I thought, even after so much of a man's life force has been&nbsp;</p>
<p>lost, his beard continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori said hello to a fat man in the bed by the window. He nodded&nbsp;</p>
<p>and smiled, apparently unable to talk. He coughed a few times and,&nbsp;</p>
<p>after sipping some water from a glass by his pillow, he shifted his&nbsp;</p>
<p>weight and rolled on his side, turning to gaze out of the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the window could be seen only a pole and some power lines,&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing more, not even a cloud in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How are you feeling, Daddy?" said Midori, speaking into her father's&nbsp;</p>
<p>ear as if testing a microphone. "How are you today?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her father moved his lips. &lt;Not good&gt; he said, not so much speaking&nbsp;</p>
<p>the words as forming them from dried air at the back of his throat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Head&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have a headache?" Midori asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Yuh &gt; he said, apparently unable to pronounce more than a syllable&nbsp;</p>
<p>or two at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, no wonder," she said, "you've just had your head cut open. Of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course it hurts. Too bad, but try to be brave. This is my friend,&nbsp;</p>
<p>217&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watanabe."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Glad to meet you," I said. Midori's father opened his lips halfway,&nbsp;</p>
<p>then closed them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori gestured towards a plastic stool near the foot of the bed and&nbsp;</p>
<p>suggested I sit down. I did as I was told. Midori gave her father a&nbsp;</p>
<p>drink of water and asked if he'd like a piece of fruit or some jellied&nbsp;</p>
<p>fruit dessert. &lt;No&gt; he said, and when Midori insisted that he had to&nbsp;</p>
<p>eat something, he said &lt;I ate).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A water bottle, a glass, a dish and a small clock stood on a night table&nbsp;</p>
<p>near the head of the bed. From a large paper bag under the table,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori took some fresh pyjamas, underwear, and other things,&nbsp;</p>
<p>straightened them out and put them into the locker by the door. There&nbsp;</p>
<p>was food for the patient at the bottom of the bag: two grapefruits, fruit&nbsp;</p>
<p>jelly and three cucumbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Cucumbers?! What are these doing in here?" Midori asked. "I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>imagine what my sister was thinking. I told her on the phone exactly&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I wanted her to buy, and I'm sure I never mentioned cucumbers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was supposed to bring kiwi fruit."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe she misunderstood you," I suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, maybe, but if she had thought about it she would have realized&nbsp;</p>
<p>that cucumbers couldn't be right. I mean, what's a patient supposed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>do? Sit in bed chewing on raw cucumbers? Hey, Daddy, want a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cucumber?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;No&gt; said Midori's father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori sat by the head of the bed, telling her father snippets of news&nbsp;</p>
<p>from home. The TV picture had gone fuzzy and she had called the&nbsp;</p>
<p>repairman; their aunt from Takaido would visit in a few days; the&nbsp;</p>
<p>chemist, Mr Miyawaki, had fallen off his bike: stuff like that. Her&nbsp;</p>
<p>father responded with grunts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;No&gt; her father answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about you, Watanabe? Some grapefruit?" "No," I answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>218&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Midori took me to the TV room and smoked a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarette on the sofa. Three patients in pyjamas were also smoking&nbsp;</p>
<p>there and watching some kind of political discussion programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey," whispered Midori with a twinkle in her eye. "That old guy with&nbsp;</p>
<p>the crutches has been looking at my legs ever since we came in. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>one with glasses in the blue pyjamas."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you expect, wearing a skirt like that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's nice, though. I bet they're all bored. It probably does them good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the excitement helps them get better faster."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As long as it doesn't have the opposite effect."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori stared at the smoke rising from her cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know," she said, "my father's not such a bad guy. I get angry&nbsp;</p>
<p>with him sometimes because he says terrible things, but deep down&nbsp;</p>
<p>he's honest and he really loved my mother. In his own way, he's lived&nbsp;</p>
<p>life with all the intensity he could muster. He's a little weak, maybe,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and he has absolutely no head for business, and people don't like him&nbsp;</p>
<p>very much, but he's a hell of a lot better than the cheats and liars who&nbsp;</p>
<p>go round smoothing things over because they're so slick. I'm as bad as&nbsp;</p>
<p>he is about not backing down once I've said something, so we fight a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot, but really, he's not a bad guy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori took my hand as if she were picking up something someone&nbsp;</p>
<p>had dropped in the street, and placed it on her lap. Half my hand lay&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the skirt, the rest touching her thigh. She looked into my eyes for&nbsp;</p>
<p>some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry to bring you to a place like this," she said, "but would&nbsp;</p>
<p>you mind staying with me a little longer?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll stay with you all day if you want," I said. "Until five." I like&nbsp;</p>
<p>spending time with you, and I've got nothing else to do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How do you usually spend your Sundays?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Doing my laundry," I said. "And ironing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you want to tell me too much about her ... your&nbsp;</p>
<p>girlfriend?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>219&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I guess not. It's complicated, and I, kind of, don't think I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>explain it very well."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK. You don't have to explain anything," said Midori. "But do&nbsp;</p>
<p>you mind if I tell you what I imagine is going on?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, go ahead. I suspect anything you'd imagine would have to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>interesting."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think she's a married woman."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You do?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, she's thirty-two or -three and she's rich and beautiful and she&nbsp;</p>
<p>wears fur coats and Charles Jourdan shoes and silk underwear and&nbsp;</p>
<p>she's hungry for sex and she likes to do really yucky things. The two&nbsp;</p>
<p>of you meet on weekday afternoons and devour each other's bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But her husband's home on Sundays, so she can't see you. Am I&nbsp;</p>
<p>right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Very, very interesting."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She has you tie her up and blindfold her and lick every square inch of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her body. Then she makes you put weird things inside her and she gets&nbsp;</p>
<p>into these incredible positions like a contortionist and you take&nbsp;</p>
<p>pictures of her with a Polaroid camera."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds like fun."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's dying for it all the time, so she does everything she can think&nbsp;</p>
<p>of. And she thinks about it every day. She's got nothing but free time,&nbsp;</p>
<p>so she's always planning: Hmm, next time Watanabe comes, we'll do&nbsp;</p>
<p>this, or we'll do that. You get in bed and she goes crazy, trying all&nbsp;</p>
<p>these positions and coming three times in each one. And she says to&nbsp;</p>
<p>you, "Don't I have a sensational body? You can't be satisfied with&nbsp;</p>
<p>young girls any more. Young girls won't do this for you, will they? Or&nbsp;</p>
<p>this. Feel good? But don't come yet!"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You've watched too many porno movies," I said with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You think so? I was kind of worried about that. But I love&nbsp;</p>
<p>porn films. Take me to one next time, OK?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," I said. "Next time you're free."&nbsp;</p>
<p>220&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really? I can hardly wait. Let's go to a real S&amp;M one, with whips&nbsp;</p>
<p>and, like, they make the girl pee in front of everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's my favourite."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We'll do it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know what I like best about porn cinemas?" "I couldn't begin to&nbsp;</p>
<p>guess."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Whenever a sex scene starts, you can hear this "Gulp!' sound when&nbsp;</p>
<p>everybody swallows all at once," said Midori. "I love that "Gulp!' It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>so sweet!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the hospital room, Midori aimed a stream of talk at her father&nbsp;</p>
<p>again, and he would either grunt in response or say nothing. Around&nbsp;</p>
<p>eleven the wife of the man in the other bed came to change her&nbsp;</p>
<p>husband's pyjamas and peel fruit for him and so on. She had a round&nbsp;</p>
<p>face and seemed like a nice person, and she and Midori shared a lot of&nbsp;</p>
<p>small talk. A nurse showed up with a new intravenous drip and talked&nbsp;</p>
<p>a little while with Midori and the wife before she left. I let my eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>wander around the room and out the window to the power lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sparrows would turn up every now and then and perch on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori talked to her father and wiped the sweat from his brow and&nbsp;</p>
<p>helped him spit phlegm into a tissue and chatted with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbouring patient's wife and the nurse and sent an occasional&nbsp;</p>
<p>remark my way and checked the intravenous contraption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctor did his rounds at 11.30, so Midori and I stepped outside to&nbsp;</p>
<p>wait in the corridor. When he came out, Midori asked him how her&nbsp;</p>
<p>father was doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, he's just come out of surgery, and we've got him on painkillers&nbsp;</p>
<p>so, well, he's pretty drained," said the doctor. "I'll need another two or&nbsp;</p>
<p>three days to evaluate the results of the operation. If it went well, he'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>be OK, and if it didn't, we'll have to make some decisions at that&nbsp;</p>
<p>point."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're not going to open his head up again, are you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>221&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really can't say until the time comes," said the doctor. "Wow, that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>some short skirt you're wearing!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nice, huh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you do on stairways?" the doctor asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing special. I let it all hang out," said Midori. The nurse&nbsp;</p>
<p>chuckled behind the doctor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Incredible. You ought to come and let us open your head one of these&nbsp;</p>
<p>days to see what's going on in there. Do me a favour and use the lifts&nbsp;</p>
<p>while you're in the hospital. I can't afford to have any more patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm way too busy as it is."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after the doctor's rounds it was lunchtime. A nurse was&nbsp;</p>
<p>circulating from room to room pushing a trolley loaded with meals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's father was given pottage, fruit, boiled, deboned fish, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>vegetables that had been ground into some kind of jelly. Midori turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>him on his back and raised him up using the handle at the foot of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed. She fed him the soup with a spoon. After five or six swallows, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned his face aside and said (No more&gt;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've got to eat at least this much." Midori san &lt;Later&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're hopeless - if you don't eat properly, you'll never get your&nbsp;</p>
<p>strength back," she said. "Don't you have to pee yet?" &lt;No&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, let's go down to the cafeteria."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agreed to go, but in fact I didn't much feel like eating. The cafeteria&nbsp;</p>
<p>was packed with doctors, nurses and visitors. Long lines of chairs and&nbsp;</p>
<p>tables filled the huge, windowless underground cavern where every&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth seemed to be eating or talking - about sickness, no doubt, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>voices echoing and re-echoing as in a tunnel. Now and then the PA&nbsp;</p>
<p>system would break through the reverberation with calls for a doctor&nbsp;</p>
<p>or nurse. While I laid claim to a table, Midori bought two set meals&nbsp;</p>
<p>and carried them over on an aluminium tray. Croquettes with cream&nbsp;</p>
<p>sauce, potato salad, shredded cabbage, boiled vegetables, rice and&nbsp;</p>
<p>miso soup: these were lined up in the tray in the same white plastic&nbsp;</p>
<p>dishes they used for patients. I ate about half of mine and left the rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>222&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori seemed to enjoy her meal to the last mouthful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not hungry?" she asked, sipping hot tea. "Not really," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's the hospital," she said, scanning the cafeteria. "This always&nbsp;</p>
<p>happens when people aren't used to the place. The smells, the sounds,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the stale air, patients' faces, stress, irritation, disappointment, pain,&nbsp;</p>
<p>fatigue - that's what does it. It grabs you in the stomach and kills your&nbsp;</p>
<p>appetite. Once you get used to it, though, it's no problem at all. Plus,&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can't really take care of a sick person unless you eat properly. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>true. I know what I'm talking about because I've done it with my&nbsp;</p>
<p>grandfather, my grandmother, my mother, and now my father. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>never know when you're going to have to , so its important to eat&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you can&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I see what you mean," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Relatives come to visit and they eat with me here, and they always&nbsp;</p>
<p>leave half their food, just like you. And they always say, "Oh, Midori,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's wonderful you've got such a healthy appetite. I'm too upset to eat.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>But get serious, I'm the one who's actually here taking care of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>patient! They just have to drop by and show a little sympathy. I'm the&nbsp;</p>
<p>one who wipes up the shit and collects the phlegm and mops the&nbsp;</p>
<p>brows. If sympathy was all it took to clean up shit, I'd have 50 times&nbsp;</p>
<p>as much sympathy as anybody else! Instead, they see me eating all my&nbsp;</p>
<p>food and they give me this look and say, "Oh Midori, you've got such&nbsp;</p>
<p>a healthy appetite.' What do they think I am, a donkey pulling a cart?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They're old enough to know how the world really works, so why are&nbsp;</p>
<p>they so stupid? It's easy to talk big, but the important thing is whether&nbsp;</p>
<p>or not you clean up the shit. I can be hurt, you know. I can get as&nbsp;</p>
<p>exhausted as anyone else. I can feel so bad I want to cry, too. I mean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>you try watching a gang of doctors get together and cut open&nbsp;</p>
<p>somebody's head when there's no hope of saving them, and stirring&nbsp;</p>
<p>things up in there, and doing it again and again, and every time they&nbsp;</p>
<p>do it it makes the person worse and a little bit crazier, and see how&nbsp;</p>
<p>you like it! And on top of it, you see your savings disappear. I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>223&nbsp;</p>
<p>know if I can keep going to university for another three-and-a-half&nbsp;</p>
<p>years, and there's no way my sister can afford a wedding ceremony at&nbsp;</p>
<p>this rate."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How many days a week do you come here?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Usually four," said Midori. "This place claims to offer total nursing&nbsp;</p>
<p>care, and the nurses are great, but there's just too much for them to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some member of the family has to be around to take up the slack. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>sister's watching the shop, and I've got my studies. Still, she manages&nbsp;</p>
<p>to get here three days a week, and I come four. And we sneak in every&nbsp;</p>
<p>now and then. Believe me, it's a full schedule!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How can you spend time with me if you're so busy?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like spending time with you," said Midori, playing with a plastic&nbsp;</p>
<p>cup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Get out of here for a couple of hours and go for a walk," I said. "I'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>take care of your father for a while." "Why?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You need to get away from the hospital and relax by yourself - not&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk to anybody, just clear your mind."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori thought about it for a minute and nodded. "Hmm, you may be&nbsp;</p>
<p>right. But do you know what to do? How to take care of him?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've been watching. I've pretty much got it. You check the&nbsp;</p>
<p>intravenous thing, give him water, wipe the sweat off, and help him&nbsp;</p>
<p>spit phlegm. The bedpan's under the bed, and if he gets hungry I feed&nbsp;</p>
<p>him the rest of his lunch. Anything I can't work out I'll ask the nurse."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think that should do it," said Midori with a smile. "There's just one&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing, though. He's starting to get a little funny in the head, so he says&nbsp;</p>
<p>weird things once in a while - things that nobody can understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't let it bother you if&nbsp;</p>
<p>he does that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll be fine," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the room, Midori told her father she had some business to take&nbsp;</p>
<p>care of and that I would be watching him while she was out. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>224&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to have nothing to say to this. It might have meant nothing to&nbsp;</p>
<p>him. He just lay there on his back, staring at the ceiling. If he hadn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>been blinking every once in a while, he could have passed for dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His eyes were bloodshot as if he had been drinking, and each time he&nbsp;</p>
<p>took&nbsp;</p>
<p>a deep breath his nostrils flared a little. Other than that, he didn't move&nbsp;</p>
<p>a muscle, and made no effort to reply to Midori. I couldn't begin to&nbsp;</p>
<p>grasp what he might be thinking or feeling in the murky depths of his&nbsp;</p>
<p>consciousness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Midori left, I thought I might try speaking to her father, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had no idea what to say to him or how to say it, so I just kept quiet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before long, he closed his eyes and went to sleep. I sat on the stool by&nbsp;</p>
<p>the head of the bed and studied the occasional twitching of his nose,&nbsp;</p>
<p>hoping all the while that he wouldn't die now. How strange it would&nbsp;</p>
<p>be, I thought, if this man were to breathe his last with me by his side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, I had just met him for the first time in my life, and the only&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing binding us together was Midori, a girl I happened to know from&nbsp;</p>
<p>my History of Drama class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was not dying, though, just sleeping peacefully. Bringing my ear&nbsp;</p>
<p>close to his face, I could hear his faint breathing. I relaxed and chatted&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the wife of the man in the next bed. She talked of nothing but&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori, assuming I was her boyfriend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's a really wonderful girl," she said. "She takes great care of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>father; she's kind and gentle and sensitive and solid, and on top of all&nbsp;</p>
<p>that, she's pretty. You'd better treat her right. Don't ever let her go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won't find another one like her."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll treat her right," I said without elaborating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have a son and daughter at home. He's 17, she's 21, and neither of&nbsp;</p>
<p>them would ever think of coming to the hospital. The minute school&nbsp;</p>
<p>finishes, they're off surfing or dating or whatever. They're terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They squeeze me for all the pocket money they can get and then they&nbsp;</p>
<p>disappear."&nbsp;</p>
<p>225&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 1.30 she left the hospital to do some shopping. Both men were&nbsp;</p>
<p>sound asleep. Gentle afternoon sunlight flooded the room, and I felt as&nbsp;</p>
<p>though I might drift off at any moment perching on my stool. Yellow&nbsp;</p>
<p>and white chrysanthemums in a vase on the table by the window&nbsp;</p>
<p>reminded people it was autumn. In the air floated the sweet smell of&nbsp;</p>
<p>boiled fish left over from lunch. The nurses continued to clip-clop up&nbsp;</p>
<p>and down the hall, talking to each other in clear, penetrating voices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They would peep into the room now and then and flash me a smile&nbsp;</p>
<p>when they saw that both patients were sleeping. I wished I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>something to read, but there were no books or magazines or&nbsp;</p>
<p>newspapers in the room, just a calendar on the wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought about Naoko. I thought about her naked, wearing only her&nbsp;</p>
<p>hairslide. I thought about the curve of her waist and the dark shadow&nbsp;</p>
<p>of her pubic hair. Why had she shown herself to me like that? Had she&nbsp;</p>
<p>been sleep-walking? Or was it just a fantasy of mine? As time went by&nbsp;</p>
<p>and that little world receded into the distance, I grew increasingly&nbsp;</p>
<p>uncertain whether the events of that night had actually happened. If I&nbsp;</p>
<p>told myself they were real, I believed they were, and if I told myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>they were a fantasy, they seemed like a fantasy. They were too clear&nbsp;</p>
<p>and detailed to have been a fantasy, and too whole and beautiful to&nbsp;</p>
<p>have been real: Naoko's body and the moonlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's father woke suddenly and started coughing, which put a stop&nbsp;</p>
<p>to my daydreaming. I helped him spit his phlegm into a tissue, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>wiped the sweat from his brow with a towel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Would you like some water?" I asked, to which he gave a four</p>
<p>millimetre nod. I held the small glass water bottle so that he could sip&nbsp;</p>
<p>a little bit at a time, dry lips trembling, throat twitching. He drank&nbsp;</p>
<p>every bit of the lukewarm water in the bottle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Would you like some more?" I asked. He seemed to be trying to&nbsp;</p>
<p>speak, so I brought my ear closer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;That's enough&gt; he said in a small, dry voice - a voice even smaller&nbsp;</p>
<p>and dryer than before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>226&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why don't you eat something? You must be hungry." He answered&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a slight nod. As Midori had done, I cranked his bed up and&nbsp;</p>
<p>started feeding him alternating spoonfuls of vegetable jelly and boiled&nbsp;</p>
<p>fish. It took an incredibly long time to get through half his food, at&nbsp;</p>
<p>which point he shook his head a little to signal he had had enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movement was almost imperceptible; it apparently hurt him to&nbsp;</p>
<p>make larger gestures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What about the fruit?" I asked him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;No&gt; he said. I wiped the corners of his mouth with a towel and made&nbsp;</p>
<p>the bed level again before taking the dishes to the corridor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Was that good?" I asked him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Awful&gt; he answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said with a smile. "It looked pretty bad." Midori's father&nbsp;</p>
<p>could not seem to decide whether to open his eyes further or close&nbsp;</p>
<p>them as he lay there silently, staring at me. I wondered if he knew who&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was. He seemed more relaxed when alone with me than when Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>was around. He had probably mistaken me for someone else. Or at&nbsp;</p>
<p>least that was how I preferred to think of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Beautiful day out there," I said, perching on the stool and crossing&nbsp;</p>
<p>my legs. "It's autumn, Sunday, great weather, and crowded&nbsp;</p>
<p>everywhere you go. Relaxing indoors like this is the best thing you&nbsp;</p>
<p>can do on such a nice day. It's exhausting in those crowds. And the air&nbsp;</p>
<p>is bad. I mostly do laundry on Sundays - wash the stuff in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning, hang it out on the roof of my dorm, take it in before the sun&nbsp;</p>
<p>goes down, do a good job of ironing it. I don't mind ironing at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a special satisfaction in making wrinkled things smooth. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty good at it, too. Of course I was terrible at it at first. I put&nbsp;</p>
<p>creases in everything. After a month of practice, though, I knew what&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was doing. So Sunday is my day for laundry and ironing. I couldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>do it today, of course. Too bad: wasted a perfect laundry day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK, though. I'll wake up early and take care of it tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry. I've got nothing else to do on a Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>227&nbsp;</p>
<p>"After I do my laundry tomorrow morning and hang it out to dry, I'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to my ten o'clock class. It's the one I'm in with Midori: History of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drama. I'm working on Euripides. Are you familiar with Euripides?&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was an ancient Greek - one of the "Big Three' of Greek tragedy&nbsp;</p>
<p>along with Aeschylus and Sophocles. He supposedly died when a dog&nbsp;</p>
<p>bit him in Macedonia, but not everybody believes this. Anyway, that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euripides. I like Sophocles better, but I suppose it's a matter of taste. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>really can't say which is better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What marks his plays is the way things get so mixed up the&nbsp;</p>
<p>characters are trapped. Do you see what I mean? Lots of different&nbsp;</p>
<p>people appear, and they all have their own situations and reasons and&nbsp;</p>
<p>excuses, and each one is pursuing his or her own idea of justice or&nbsp;</p>
<p>happiness. As a result, nobody can do anything. Obviously. I mean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's basically impossible for everybody's justice to prevail or&nbsp;</p>
<p>everybody's happiness to triumph, so chaos takes over. And then what&nbsp;</p>
<p>do you think happens? Simple - a god appears at the end and starts&nbsp;</p>
<p>directing the traffic. "You go over there, and you come here, and you&nbsp;</p>
<p>get together with her, and you just sit still for while.' Like that. He's a&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind of fixer, and in the end everything works out perfectly. They call&nbsp;</p>
<p>this 'deus ex machina'. There's almost always a deus ex machina in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euripides, and that's where critical opinion divides over him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But think about it - what if there were a deus ex machina&nbsp; in real life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything would be so easy! If you felt stuck or trapped, some god&nbsp;</p>
<p>would swing down from up there and solve all your problems. What&nbsp;</p>
<p>could be easier than that? Anyway, that's History of Drama. This is&nbsp;</p>
<p>more or less the kind of stuff we study at university."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's father said nothing, but he kept his vacant eyes on me the&nbsp;</p>
<p>whole time I was talking. Of course, I couldn't tell from those eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>whether he understood anything I was saying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Peace," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all that talk, I felt starved. I had had next to nothing for breakfast&nbsp;</p>
<p>and had eaten only half my lunch. Now I was sorry I hadn't eaten&nbsp;</p>
<p>228&nbsp;</p>
<p>more at lunch, but feeling sorry wasn't going to help. I looked in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cabinet for something to eat, but found only a can of nori, some Vicks&nbsp;</p>
<p>cough drops and soy sauce. The paper bag was still there with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>cucumbers and grapefruit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm going to eat some cucumbers if you don't mind," I said to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's father. He didn't answer. I washed three cucumbers in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sink and dribbled a little soy sauce into a dish. Then I wrapped a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cucumber in nori, dipped it in soy sauce and gobbled it down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Mmm, great!" I said to Midori's father. "Fresh, simple, smells like&nbsp;</p>
<p>life. Really good cucumbers. A far more sensible food than kiwi&nbsp;</p>
<p>fruit."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I polished off one cucumber and attacked the next. The sickroom&nbsp;</p>
<p>echoed with the sound of me munching cucumbers. Only after I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>finished the second whole cucumber was I ready to take a break. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>boiled some water on the gas burner in the hall and made tea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Would you like something to drink? Water? Juice?" I asked Midori's&nbsp;</p>
<p>father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Cucumber&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great," I said with a smile. "With nori?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gave a little nod. I cranked the bed up again. Then I cut a bite</p>
<p>sized piece of cucumber, wrapped it with a strip of nori, stabbed the&nbsp;</p>
<p>combination with a toothpick, dipped it in soy sauce, and delivered it&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the patient's waiting mouth. With almost no change of expression,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's father crunched down on the piece again and again and&nbsp;</p>
<p>finally swallowed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How was that? Good, huh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Good&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's good when food tastes good," I said. "It's kind of like proof you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>alive."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He ended up eating the entire cucumber. When he had finished it, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted water, so I gave him a drink from the bottle. A few minutes&nbsp;</p>
<p>later, he said he needed to pee, so I took the urine jar from under the&nbsp;</p>
<p>229&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed and held it by the tip of his penis. Afterwards I emptied the jar&nbsp;</p>
<p>into the toilet and washed it out. Then I went back to the sickroom and&nbsp;</p>
<p>finished my tea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How are you feeling?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;My. ... head&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hurts?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;A little&gt; he said with a slight frown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, no wonder, you've just had an operation. Of course, I've never&nbsp;</p>
<p>had one, so I don't know what it's like." &lt;Ticket&gt; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ticket? What ticket?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Midori&gt; he said. &lt;Ticket&gt;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no idea what he was talking about, and just kept quiet. He stayed&nbsp;</p>
<p>silent for a time, too. Then he seemed to say &lt;Please&gt;. He opened his&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes wide and looked at me hard. I guessed that he was trying to tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>me something, but I couldn't begin to imagine what it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Ueno&gt; he said. &lt;Midori&gt;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ueno Station?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gave a little nod.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to summarize what he was getting at: "Ticket, Midori, please,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ueno Station," but I had no idea what it meant. I assumed his mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>was muddled, but compared with before his eyes now had a terrible&nbsp;</p>
<p>clarity. He raised the arm that was free of the intravenous contraption&nbsp;</p>
<p>and stretched it towards me. This must have been a major effort for&nbsp;</p>
<p>him, the way the hand trembled in mid-air. I stood and grasped his&nbsp;</p>
<p>frail, wrinkled hand. He returned my grasp with what little strength he&nbsp;</p>
<p>could muster and said again &lt;Please&gt;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry," I said. "I'll take care of the ticket and Midori, too." He&nbsp;</p>
<p>let his hand drop back to the bed and closed his eyes. Then, with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>loud rush of breath, he fell asleep. I checked to make sure he was still&nbsp;</p>
<p>alive, then went out to boil more water for tea. As I was sipping the&nbsp;</p>
<p>hot liquid, I realized that I had developed a kind of liking for this little&nbsp;</p>
<p>man on the verge of death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>230&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wife of the other patient came back a few minutes later and asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>if everything was OK. I assured her it was. Her husband, too, was&nbsp;</p>
<p>sound asleep, breathing deeply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori came back after three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was in the park, spacing out," she said. "I did what you told me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't talk to anybody, just let my head go empty."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How was it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks, I feel much better. I still have that draggy, tired feeling, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>my body feels much lighter than before. I guess I was more tired than&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realized."&nbsp;</p>
<p>With her father sound asleep, there was nothing for us to do, so we&nbsp;</p>
<p>bought coffee from a vending machine and drank it in the TV room. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>reported to Midori on what had happened in her absence - that her&nbsp;</p>
<p>father had had a good sleep, then woke up and ate some of what was&nbsp;</p>
<p>left of his lunch, then saw me eating a cucumber and asked for one&nbsp;</p>
<p>himself, ate the whole thing and peed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Watanabe, you're amazing," said Midori. "We're all going crazy&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to get him to eat anything, and you got him to eat a whole&nbsp;</p>
<p>cucumber! Incredible!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, I think he just saw me enjoying my own cucumber."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Or maybe you just have this knack for relaxing people." "No way," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said with a laugh. "A lot of people will tell you just the opposite about&nbsp;</p>
<p>me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you think about my father?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like him. Not that we had all that much to say to each&nbsp;</p>
<p>other. But, I don't know, he seems nice." "Was he quiet?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Very."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You should have seen him a week ago. He was awful," Midori said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>shaking her head. "Kind of lost his marbles and went wild. Threw a&nbsp;</p>
<p>glass at me and yelled terrible stuff - 'I hope you die, you stupid bitch!'&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sickness can do that to people. They don't know why, but it can&nbsp;</p>
<p>231&nbsp;</p>
<p>make people get really vicious all of a sudden. It was the same with&nbsp;</p>
<p>my mother. What do you think she said to me? "You're not my&nbsp;</p>
<p>daughter! I hate your guts!' The whole world turned black for me for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>second when she said that. But that kind of thing is one of the features&nbsp;</p>
<p>of this particular sickness. Something presses on a part of the brain&nbsp;</p>
<p>and makes people say all kinds of nasty things. You know it's just part&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the sickness, but still, it hurts. What do you expect? Here I am,&nbsp;</p>
<p>working my fingers to the bone for them, and they're saying all this&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible stuff to me-"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know what you mean," I said. Then I remembered the strange&nbsp;</p>
<p>fragments that Midori's father had mumbled to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ticket? Ueno Station?" Midori said. "I wonder what that's all about?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And then he said, Please, and Midori.", "Please take care of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori?"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Or maybe he wants you to go to Ueno and buy a ticket. The order of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the four words is such a mess, who knows what he means? Does Ueno&nbsp;</p>
<p>Station mean anything special to you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm, Ueno Station." Midori thought about it for a while. "The only&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing I can think of is the two times I ran away, when I was eight and&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I was ten. Both times I took a train from Ueno to Fukushima.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bought the tickets with money I took from the till. Somebody at home&nbsp;</p>
<p>made me really angry, and I did it to get even. I had an aunt in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fukushima, I kind of liked her, so I went to her house. My father was&nbsp;</p>
<p>the one who brought me home. Came all the way to Fukushima to get&nbsp;</p>
<p>me - a hundred miles! We ate boxed lunches on the train to Ueno. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>father told me all kinds of stuff while we were travelling, just little bits&nbsp;</p>
<p>and pieces with long spaces in between. Like about the big earthquake&nbsp;</p>
<p>of 1923 or about the war or about the time I was born, stuff he didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>usually talk about. Come to think of it, those were the only times my&nbsp;</p>
<p>father and I had something like a good, long talk, just the two of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, can you believe this? - my father was smack bang in the middle&nbsp;</p>
<p>of Tokyo during one of the biggest earthquakes in history and he&nbsp;</p>
<p>232&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't even notice it!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true! He was riding through Koishikawa with a cart on the back&nbsp;</p>
<p>of his bike, and he didn't feel a thing. When he got home, all the tiles&nbsp;</p>
<p>had fallen off the roofs in the neighbourhood, and everyone in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>family was hugging pillars and quaking in their boots. He still didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>get it and, the way he tells it, he asked, "What the hell's going on&nbsp;</p>
<p>here?' That's my father's "fond recollection' of the Great Kanto&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earthquake!" Midori laughed. "All his stories of the old days are like&nbsp;</p>
<p>that. No drama whatsoever. They're all just a little bit off-centre. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't know, when he tells those stories, you kind of get the feeling like&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing important has happened in Japan for the past 50 or 60 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young officers' uprising of 1936, the Pacific War, they're all kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of "Oh yeah, now that you mention it, I guess something like that once&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened' kind of things. It's so funny!&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, anyway, on the train, he'd tell me these stories in bits and pieces&nbsp;</p>
<p>while we were riding from Fukushima to Ueno. And at the end, he'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>always say, "So that goes to show you, Midori, it's the same wherever&nbsp;</p>
<p>you go.' I was young enough to be impressed by stuff like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So is that your "fond recollection' of Ueno Station?" I asked. "Yeah,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>said Midori. "Did you ever run away from home, Watanabe?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why not?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lack of imagination. It never occurred to me to run away." "You are&nbsp;</p>
<p>so weird!" Midori said, cocking her head as though truly impressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, I think my father was trying to say he wanted you to&nbsp;</p>
<p>look after me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really! I understand things like that. Intuitively. So tell me, what was&nbsp;</p>
<p>your answer to him?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't understand what he was saying, so I just said OK, don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>233&nbsp;</p>
<p>worry, I'd take care of both you and the ticket."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You promised my father that? You said you'd take care of&nbsp;</p>
<p>me?" She looked me straight in the eye with a dead-serious expression&nbsp;</p>
<p>on her face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not like that," I hastened to correct her. "I really didn't know what he&nbsp;</p>
<p>was saying, and - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'm just kidding," she said with a smile. "I love that&nbsp;</p>
<p>about you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori and I finished our coffee and went back to the room. Her father&nbsp;</p>
<p>was still sound asleep. If you leaned close you could hear his steady&nbsp;</p>
<p>breathing. As the afternoon deepened, the light outside the hospital&nbsp;</p>
<p>window changed to the soft, gentle colour of autumn. A flock of birds&nbsp;</p>
<p>rested on the electric wire outside, then flew on. Midori and I sat in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>corner of the room, talking quietly the whole time. She read my palm&nbsp;</p>
<p>and predicted that I would live to 105, marry three times, and die in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>traffic accident. "Not a bad life," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When her father woke just after four o'clock, Midori went to sit by his&nbsp;</p>
<p>pillow, wiped the sweat from his brow, gave him water, and asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>him about the pain in his head. A nurse came and took his&nbsp;</p>
<p>temperature, recorded the number of his urinations, and checked the&nbsp;</p>
<p>intravenous equipment. I went to the TV room and watched a little&nbsp;</p>
<p>football.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At five I told Midori I would be leaving. To her father I explained, "I&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to go to work now. I sell records in Shinjuku from six to 10.30."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He turned his eyes to me and gave a little nod.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, I don't know how to put this, but I really want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for today," Midori said to me when she saw me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>reception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I didn't do that much," I said. "But if I can be of any help, I'll come&nbsp;</p>
<p>next week, too. I'd like to see your father again."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, there's not that much for me to do in the dorm, and if I come&nbsp;</p>
<p>234&nbsp;</p>
<p>here I get to eat cucumbers."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori folded her arms and tapped the linoleum with the heel of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>shoe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like to go drinking with you again," she said, cocking her head&nbsp;</p>
<p>slightly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about the porno movies?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We'll do that first and then go drinking. And we'll talk about all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>usual disgusting things."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not the one who talks about disgusting things," I protested. "It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, we'll talk about things like that and get plastered and go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you know what happens next," I said with a sigh. "I try to do it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and you don't let me. Right?" She laughed through her nose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway," I said, "pick me up again next Sunday morning. We'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>come here together."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With me in a little longer skirt?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Definitely," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't go to the hospital that next Sunday, though. Midori's father&nbsp;</p>
<p>died on Friday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She called at 6.30 in the morning to tell me that. The buzzer letting me&nbsp;</p>
<p>know I had a phone call went off and I ran down to the lobby with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cardigan thrown over my pyjamas. A cold rain was falling silently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My father died a few minutes ago," Midori said in a small, quiet&nbsp;</p>
<p>voice. I asked her if there was anything I could do. "Thanks," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's really nothing. We're used to funerals. I just wanted to let you&nbsp;</p>
<p>know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A kind of sigh escaped her lips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't come to the funeral, OK? I hate stuff like that. I don't want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>see you there."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I get it," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>235&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Will you really take me to a porno movie?" "Of course I will."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A really disgusting one."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll research the matter thoroughly." "Good. I'll call you," she said and&nbsp;</p>
<p>hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A week went by without a word from Midori. No calls, no sign of her&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the lecture hall. I kept hoping for a message from her whenever I&nbsp;</p>
<p>went back to the dorm, but there were never any. One night, I tried to&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep my promise by thinking of her when I masturbated, but it didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>work. I tried switching over to Naoko, but not even Naoko's image&nbsp;</p>
<p>was any help that time. It seemed so ridiculous I gave up. I took a&nbsp;</p>
<p>swig of whisky, brushed my teeth and went to bed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote a letter to Naoko on Sunday morning. One thing I told her&nbsp;</p>
<p>about was Midori's father. I went to the hospital to visit the father of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl in one of my lectures and ate some cucumbers in his room. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>he heard me crunching on them, he wanted some too, and he ate his&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the same crunching sound. Five days later, though, he died. I still&nbsp;</p>
<p>have a vivid memory of the tiny crunching he made when he chewed&nbsp;</p>
<p>his pieces of cucumber. People leave strange, little memories of&nbsp;</p>
<p>themselves behind when they die. My letter went on:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of you and Reiko and the aviary while I lie in bed after waking&nbsp;</p>
<p>up in the morning. I think about the peacock and pigeons and parrots&nbsp;</p>
<p>and turkeys - and about the rabbits. I remember the yellow raincapes&nbsp;</p>
<p>you and Reiko wore with the hoods up that rainy morning. It feels&nbsp;</p>
<p>good to think about you when I’m warm in bed. I feel as if you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>curled up there beside me, fast asleep. And I think how great it would&nbsp;</p>
<p>be if it were true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I miss you terribly sometimes, but in general I go on living with all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>energy I can muster. Just as you take care of the birds and the fields&nbsp;</p>
<p>every morning, every morning I wind my own spring. I give it some&nbsp;</p>
<p>236&nbsp;</p>
<p>36 good twists by the time I've got up, brushed my teeth, shaved, eaten&nbsp;</p>
<p>breakfast, changed my clothes, left the dorm, and arrived at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>university. I tell myself, "OK, let's make this day another good one." I&nbsp;</p>
<p>hadn't noticed before, but they tell me I talk to myself a lot these days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably mumbling to myself while I wind my spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard not being able to see you, but my life in Tokyo would be a lot&nbsp;</p>
<p>worse if it weren't for you. It's because I think of you when I'm in bed&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the morning that I can wind my spring and tell myself I have to live&nbsp;</p>
<p>another good day. I know I have to give it my best here just as you are&nbsp;</p>
<p>doing there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today's Sunday, though, a day I don't wind my spring. I've done my&nbsp;</p>
<p>laundry, and now I'm in my room, writing to you. Once I've finished&nbsp;</p>
<p>this letter and put a stamp on it and dropped it into the postbox, there's&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing for me to do until the sun goes down. I don't study on&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays, either. I do a good enough job on weekdays studying in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>library between lectures, so I don't have anything left to do on&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays. Sunday afternoons are quiet, peaceful and, for me, lonely. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>read books or listen to music. Sometimes I think back on the different&nbsp;</p>
<p>routes we used to take in our Sunday walks around Tokyo. I can come&nbsp;</p>
<p>up with a pretty clear picture of the clothes you were wearing on any&nbsp;</p>
<p>particular walk. I remember all kinds of things on Sunday afternoons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say "Hi" from me to Reiko. I really miss her guitar at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I had finished the letter, I walked a couple of blocks to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>postbox, then bought an egg sandwich and a Coke at a nearby bakery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had these for lunch while I sat on a bench and watched some boys&nbsp;</p>
<p>playing baseball in a local playground. The deepening of autumn had&nbsp;</p>
<p>brought an increased blueness and depth to the sky. I glanced up to&nbsp;</p>
<p>find two vapour trails heading off to the west in perfect parallel like&nbsp;</p>
<p>tram tracks. A foul ball came rolling my way, and when I threw it&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to them the young players doffed their caps with a polite "Thank&nbsp;</p>
<p>you, sir". As in most junior baseball, there were lots of walks and&nbsp;</p>
<p>237&nbsp;</p>
<p>stolen bases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After noon I went back to my room to read but couldn't concentrate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead I found myself staring at the ceiling and thinking about&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori. I wondered if her father had really been trying to ask me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>look after her when he was gone, but I had no way of telling what had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been on his mind. He had probably confused me with somebody else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, he had died on a Friday morning when a cold rain was&nbsp;</p>
<p>falling, and now it was impossible to know the truth. I imagined that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>in death, he had shrivelled up smaller than ever. And then they had&nbsp;</p>
<p>burned him in an oven until he was nothing but ashes. And what had&nbsp;</p>
<p>he left behind? A nothing-much bookshop in a nothing-much&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbourhood and two daughters, at least one of whom was more&nbsp;</p>
<p>than a little strange. What kind of life was that? I wondered. Lying in&nbsp;</p>
<p>that hospital bed with his cut-open head and his muddled brain, what&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been on his mind as he looked at me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking thoughts like this about Midori's father put me into such a&nbsp;</p>
<p>miserable mood that I had to bring the laundry down from the roof&nbsp;</p>
<p>before it was really dry and set off for Shinjuku to kill time walking&nbsp;</p>
<p>the streets. The Sunday crowds gave me some relief. The Kinokuniya&nbsp;</p>
<p>bookshop was as jampacked as a rush-hour train. I bought a copy of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faulkner's Light in August and went to the noisiest jazz café I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>think of, reading my new book while listening to Ornette Coleman and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bud Powell and drinking hot, thick, foul-tasting coffee. At 5.30 I&nbsp;</p>
<p>closed my book, went outside and ate a light supper. How many&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays - how many hundreds of Sundays like this - lay ahead of me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Quiet, peaceful, and lonely," I said aloud to myself. On Sundays, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't wind my spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>238&nbsp;</p>
<p>Halfway through that week I managed to cut my palm open on a piece&nbsp;</p>
<p>of broken glass. I hadn't noticed that one of the glass partitions in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>record shelf was cracked. I could hardly believe how much blood&nbsp;</p>
<p>gushed out of me, turning the floor bright red at my feet. The shop&nbsp;</p>
<p>manager found some towels and tied them tightly around the wound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then he made a phone call to casualty. He was a pretty useless guy&nbsp;</p>
<p>most of the time, but he acted with surprising efficiency. The hospital&nbsp;</p>
<p>was nearby, fortunately, but by the time I got there the towels were&nbsp;</p>
<p>soaked in red, and the blood they couldn't soak up had been dripping&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the tarmac. People scurried out of the way for me. They seemed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>think I had been injured in a fight. I felt no pain to speak of, but the&nbsp;</p>
<p>blood wouldn't stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctor was cool as he removed the blood-soaked towels, stopped&nbsp;</p>
<p>the bleeding with a tourniquet on my wrist, disinfected the wound and&nbsp;</p>
<p>sewed it up, telling me to come again the next day. Back at the record&nbsp;</p>
<p>shop, the manager told me to go home: he would put me down as&nbsp;</p>
<p>having worked my shift. I took a bus to the dorm and went straight to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa's room. With my nerves on edge over the cut, I wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk to somebody, and I hadn't seen Nagasawa for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found him in his room, drinking a can of beer and watching a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spanish lesson on TV. "What the hell happened to you?" he asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>when he saw my bandage. I said I had cut myself but that it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing much. He offered me a beer and I said no thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just wait. This'll be over in a minute," said Nagasawa, and he went&nbsp;</p>
<p>on practising his Spanish pronunciation. I boiled some water and&nbsp;</p>
<p>239&nbsp;</p>
<p>made myself a cup of tea with a tea bag. A Spanish woman recited&nbsp;</p>
<p>example sentences: "I have never seen such terrible rain!", "Many&nbsp;</p>
<p>bridges were washed away in Barcelona." Nagasawa read the text&nbsp;</p>
<p>aloud in Spanish. "What awful sentences!" he said. "This kind of shit&nbsp;</p>
<p>is all they ever give you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the programme ended, he turned off the TV and took another&nbsp;</p>
<p>beer from his small refrigerator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you sure I'm not in the way?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way. I was bored out of my mind. Sure you don't want a beer?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I really don't," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, they posted the exam results the other day. I passed!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Foreign Ministry exam?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's it. Officially, it's called the "Foreign Affairs Public Service&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personnel First Class Service Examination'. What a joke!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Congratulations!" I said and gave him my left hand to shake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course, I'm not surprised you passed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, neither am I," laughed Nagasawa. "But it's nice to have it&nbsp;</p>
<p>official."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Think you'll go abroad once you get in?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, first they give you a year of training. Then they send you&nbsp;</p>
<p>overseas for a while."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sipped my tea, and he drank his beer with obvious satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll give you this fridge if you'd like it when I get out of here," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa. "You'd like to have it, wouldn't you? It's great for beer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'd like to have it, but won't you need it? You'll be living in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>flat or something."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be stupid! When I get out of this place, I'm buying myself a big&nbsp;</p>
<p>fridge. I'm gonna live the high life! Four years in a shithole like this is&nbsp;</p>
<p>long enough. I don't want to have to look at anything I used in this&nbsp;</p>
<p>place. You name it, I'll give it to you - the TV, the thermos flask, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>radio. .."&nbsp;</p>
<p>240&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll take anything you want to give me," I said. I picked up the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spanish textbook on his desk and stared at it. "You're starting&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spanish?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. The more languages you know the better. And I've got a knack&nbsp;</p>
<p>for them. I taught myself French and it's practically perfect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Languages are like games. You learn the rules for one, and they all&nbsp;</p>
<p>work the same way. Like women."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ah, the reflective life!" I said with a sarcastic edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, let's eat out soon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean cruising for women?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, a real dinner. You, me and Hatsumi at a good restaurant. To&nbsp;</p>
<p>celebrate my new job. My old man's paying, so we'll go somewhere&nbsp;</p>
<p>really expensive."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Shouldn't it just be you and Hatsumi?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, it'd be better with you there. I'd be more comfortable, and so&nbsp;</p>
<p>would Hatsumi."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh no, it was Kizuki, Naoko and me all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll spend the night at Hatsumi's afterwards, so join us just for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>meal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, if you both really want me to," I said. "But, anyway, what are&nbsp;</p>
<p>you planning to do about Hatsumi? You'll be assigned overseas when&nbsp;</p>
<p>you finish your training, and you probably won't come back for years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going to happen to her?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's her problem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't get it," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feet on his desk, Nagasawa took a swig of beer and yawned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look, I'm not planning to get married. I've made that perfectly clear&nbsp;</p>
<p>to Hatsumi. If she wants to marry someone, she should go ahead and&nbsp;</p>
<p>do it. I won't stop her. If she wants to wait for me, let her wait. That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I mean."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have to hand it to you," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You think I'm a shit, don't you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>241&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look, the world is an inherently unfair place. I didn't write the rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's always been that way. I have never once deceived Hatsumi. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>knows I'm a shit and that she can leave me whenever she decides she&nbsp;</p>
<p>can't take it. I told her that straight from the start."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa finished his beer and lit a cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Isn't there anything about life that frightens you?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm not a total idiot," said Nagasawa. "Of course life frightens&nbsp;</p>
<p>me sometimes. I don't happen to take that as the premise for&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything else, though. I'm going to give it 100 per cent and go as far&nbsp;</p>
<p>as I can. I'll take what I want and leave what I don't want. That's how I&nbsp;</p>
<p>intend to live my life, and if things go bad, I'll stop and reconsider at&nbsp;</p>
<p>that point. If you think about it, an unfair society is a society that&nbsp;</p>
<p>makes it possible for you to exploit your abilities to the limit."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sounds like a pretty self-centred way to live," I said. "Perhaps, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not just looking up at the sky and waiting for the fruit to drop. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>my own way, I'm working hard. I'm working ten times harder than&nbsp;</p>
<p>you are."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's probably true," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I look around me sometimes and I get sick to my stomach. Why the&nbsp;</p>
<p>hell don't these bastards do something? I wonder. They don't do a&nbsp;</p>
<p>fucking thing, and then they moan about it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazed at the harshness of his tone, I looked at Nagasawa. "The way&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see it, people are working hard. They're working their fingers to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>bone. Or am I looking at things wrong?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's not hard work. It's just manual labour," Nagasawa said with&nbsp;</p>
<p>finality. "The "hard work' I'm talking about is more self-directed and&nbsp;</p>
<p>purposeful."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean, like studying Spanish while everyone else is taking it&nbsp;</p>
<p>easy?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's it. I'm going to have Spanish mastered by next spring. I've got&nbsp;</p>
<p>English and German and French down pat, and I'm almost there with&nbsp;</p>
<p>242&nbsp;</p>
<p>Italian. You think things like that happen without hard work?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa puffed on his cigarette while I thought about Midori's&nbsp;</p>
<p>father. There was one man who had probably never even thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about starting Spanish lessons on TV He had probably never thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about the difference between hard work and manual labour, either. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>was probably too busy to think about such things - busy with work,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and busy bringing home a daughter who had run away to Fukushima.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, about that dinner of ours," said Nagasawa. "Would this Saturday&nbsp;</p>
<p>be OK for you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa picked a fancy French restaurant in a quiet backstreet of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azabu. He gave his name at the door and the two of us were shown to&nbsp;</p>
<p>a secluded private room. Some 15 prints hung on the walls of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>small chamber. While we waited for Hatsumi to arrive, Nagasawa and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sipped a delicious wine and chatted about the novels of Joseph&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conrad. He wore an expensive-looking grey suit. I had on an ordinary&nbsp;</p>
<p>blue blazer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi arrived 15 minutes later. She was carefully made up and&nbsp;</p>
<p>wore gold earrings, a beautiful deep blue dress, and tasteful red court&nbsp;</p>
<p>shoes. When I complimented her on the colour of her dress, she told&nbsp;</p>
<p>me it was called midnight blue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What an elegant restaurant!" she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My old man always eats here when he comes to Tokyo," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa. "I came here with him once. I'm not crazy about these&nbsp;</p>
<p>snooty places."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It doesn't hurt to eat in a place like this once in a while," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi. Turning to me, she asked, "Don't you agree?" "I guess so. As&nbsp;</p>
<p>long as I'm not paying."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My old man usually brings his mistress here," said Nagasawa. "He's&nbsp;</p>
<p>got one in Tokyo, you know." "Really?" asked Hatsumi. I took a sip of&nbsp;</p>
<p>wine, as if I had heard nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>243&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually a waiter came and took our orders. After choosing hors&nbsp;</p>
<p>d'oeuvres and soup, Nagasawa ordered duck, and Hatsumi and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordered sea bass. The food arrived at a leisurely pace, which allowed&nbsp;</p>
<p>us to enjoy the wine and conversation. Nagasawa spoke first of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry exam. Most of the examinees were scum who might&nbsp;</p>
<p>just as well be thrown into a bottomless pit, he said, though he&nbsp;</p>
<p>supposed there were a few decent ones in the bunch. I asked if he&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought the ratio of good ones to scum was higher or lower than in&nbsp;</p>
<p>society at large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's the same," he said. "Of course." It was the same everywhere, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>added: an immutable law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa ordered a second bottle of wine and a double Scotch for&nbsp;</p>
<p>himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi then began talking about a girl she wanted to fix me up with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a perpetual topic between us. She was always telling me&nbsp;</p>
<p>about some "cute girl in my club", and I was always running away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's really nice, though, and really cute. I'll bring her along next&nbsp;</p>
<p>time. You ought to talk to her. I'm sure you'll like her."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a waste of time, Hatsumi," I said. "I'm too poor to go out with&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls from your university. I can't talk to them."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be silly," she said. "This girl is simple and natural and&nbsp;</p>
<p>unaffected."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come on, Watanabe," said Nagasawa. "Just meet her. You don't have&nbsp;</p>
<p>to screw her."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I should say not!" said Hatsumi. "She's a virgin."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like you used to be," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Hatsumi with a bright smile. "Like I used to be. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>really," she said to me, "don't give me that stuff about being "too&nbsp;</p>
<p>poor'. It's got nothing to do with it. Sure, there are a few super-stuck</p>
<p>up girls in every year, but the rest of us are just ordinary. We all eat&nbsp;</p>
<p>lunch in the school cafeteria for ?250 - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now wait just a minute, Hatsumi," I said, interrupting her. "In my&nbsp;</p>
<p>244&nbsp;</p>
<p>school the cafeteria has three lunches: A, B, and C. The A Lunch is&nbsp;</p>
<p>?120, the B Lunch is ?100, and the C Lunch is ?80. Everybody gives&nbsp;</p>
<p>me dirty looks when I eat the A Lunch, and anyone who can't afford&nbsp;</p>
<p>the C Lunch eats ramen noodles for ?60. That's the kind of place I go&nbsp;</p>
<p>to. You still think I can talk to girls from yours?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi could barely stop laughing. "That's so cheap!" she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe I should go there for lunch! But really, Toru, you're such a&nbsp;</p>
<p>nice guy, I'm sure you'd get along with this girl. She might even like&nbsp;</p>
<p>the ?120 lunch."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said with a laugh. "Nobody eats that stuff because they&nbsp;</p>
<p>like it; they eat it because they can't afford anything else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, don't judge a book by its cover. It's true we go to this hoity</p>
<p>toity establishment, but lots of us there are serious people who think&nbsp;</p>
<p>serious thoughts about life. Not everybody is looking for a boyfriend&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a sports car."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know that much," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Watanabe's got a girl. He's in love," said Nagasawa. "But he won't&nbsp;</p>
<p>say a word about her. He's as tight-lipped as they come. A riddle&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrapped in an enigma."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?" Hatsumi asked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really," I said. "But there's no riddle involved here. It's just that it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>complicated, and hard to talk about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"An illicit love? Ooh! You can talk to me!" I took a sip of wine to&nbsp;</p>
<p>avoid answering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"See what I mean?" said Nagasawa, at work on his third whisky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tight-lipped. When this guy decides he's not going to talk about&nbsp;</p>
<p>something, nobody can drag it out of him." "What a shame," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi as she cut a small slice of terrine and brought it to her lips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you'd got on with her, we could have double-dated."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, we could've got drunk and done a little swapping," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Enough of that kind of talk," said Hatsumi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>245&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you mean "that kind of talk'? Watanabe's got his eye on&nbsp;</p>
<p>you," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about," Hatsumi&nbsp;</p>
<p>murmured. "He's not that kind of person. He's sincere and caring. I can&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell. That's why I've been trying to fix him up."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, he's sincere. Like the time we swapped women once, way&nbsp;</p>
<p>back when. Remember, Watanabe?" Nagasawa said this with a blasé&nbsp;</p>
<p>look on his face, then slugged back the rest of his whisky and ordered&nbsp;</p>
<p>another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi set her knife and fork down and dabbed at her mouth with&nbsp;</p>
<p>her napkin. Then, looking at me, she asked, "Toru, did you really do&nbsp;</p>
<p>that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know how to answer her, and so I said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell her," said Nagasawa. "What the hell." The mood was turning&nbsp;</p>
<p>sour. Nagasawa could get nasty when he was drunk, but tonight his&nbsp;</p>
<p>nastiness was aimed at Hatsumi, not at me. Knowing that made it all&nbsp;</p>
<p>the more difficult for me to go on sitting there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like to hear about that," said Hatsumi. "It sounds very interesting!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We were drunk," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's all right, Toru. I'm not blaming you. I just want you to tell me&nbsp;</p>
<p>what happened."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The two of us were drinking in a bar in Shibuya, and we got friendly&nbsp;</p>
<p>with this pair of girls. They went to some college, and they were&nbsp;</p>
<p>pretty plastered, too. So, anyway, we, uh, went to a hotel and slept&nbsp;</p>
<p>with them. Our rooms were right next door to each other. In the&nbsp;</p>
<p>middle of the night, Nagasawa knocked on my door and said we&nbsp;</p>
<p>should change girls, so I went to his room and he came to mine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Didn't the girls mind?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, they were drunk too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anyway, I had a good reason for doing it," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A good reason?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, the girls were too different. One was really goodlooking, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>246&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other one was a dog. It seemed unfair to me. I got the pretty girl,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but Watanabe got stuck with the other one. That's why we swapped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right, Watanabe?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I s'pose so," I said. But in fact, I had liked the not-pretty one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was fun to talk to and a nice person. After we had sex, we were&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoying talking to each other in bed when Nagasawa showed up and&nbsp;</p>
<p>suggested we change partners. I asked the girl if she minded, and she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said it was OK with her if that's what we wanted. She probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought I wanted to do it with the pretty one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Was it fun?" Hatsumi asked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Swapping, you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The whole thing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not especially. It's just something you do. Sleeping with girls that&nbsp;</p>
<p>way is not all that much fun."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So why do you do it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because of me," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm asking Toru," Hatsumi shot back at Nagasawa. "Why do you do&nbsp;</p>
<p>something like that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because sometimes I have this tremendous desire to sleep with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>girl."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you're in love with someone, can't you manage one way or another&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her?" Hatsumi asked after a few moments' thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's complicated."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi sighed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point the door opened and the food was carried in. Nagasawa&nbsp;</p>
<p>was presented with his roast duck, and Hatsumi and I received our sea&nbsp;</p>
<p>bass. The waiters heaped freshcooked vegetables on our plates and&nbsp;</p>
<p>dribbled sauce on them before withdrawing and leaving the three of us&nbsp;</p>
<p>alone again. Nagasawa cut a slice of duck and ate it with gusto,&nbsp;</p>
<p>followed by more whisky. I took a forkful of spinach. Hatsumi didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>touch her food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>247&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, Toru," she said, "I have no idea what makes your&nbsp;</p>
<p>situation so "complicated', but I do think that the kind of thing you just&nbsp;</p>
<p>told me about is not right for you. You're not that kind of person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think?" She placed her hands on the table and looked me&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the eye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "I've felt that way myself sometimes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So why don't you stop?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because sometimes I have a need for human warmth," I answered&nbsp;</p>
<p>honestly. "Sometimes, if I can't feel something like the warmth of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>woman's skin, I get so lonely I can't stand it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Here, let me summarize what I think it's all about," interjected&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa. "Watanabe's got this girl he likes, but for certain&nbsp;</p>
<p>complicated reasons, they can't do it. So he tells himself "Sex is just&nbsp;</p>
<p>sex', and he takes care of his need with somebody else. What's wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p>with that? It makes perfect sense. He can't just stay locked in his room&nbsp;</p>
<p>tossing off all the time, can he?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But if you really love her, Toru, shouldn't it be possible for you to&nbsp;</p>
<p>control yourself?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe so," I said, bringing a piece of sea bass in cream sauce to my&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You just don't understand a man's sexual needs," said Nagasawa to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi. "Look at me, for example. I've been with you for three years,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I've slept with plenty of women in that time. But I don't remember&nbsp;</p>
<p>a thing about them. I don't know their names, I don't remember their&nbsp;</p>
<p>faces. I slept with each of them exactly once. Meet 'em, do it, so long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it. What's wrong with that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What I can't stand is that arrogance of yours," said Hatsumi in a soft&nbsp;</p>
<p>voice. "Whether you sleep with other women or not is beside the&nbsp;</p>
<p>point. I've never really been angry with you for sleeping around, have&nbsp;</p>
<p>I?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't even call what I do sleeping around. It's just a game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>248&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody gets hurt," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I get hurt," said Hatsumi. "Why am I not enough for you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa kept silent for a moment and swirled the whisky in his&nbsp;</p>
<p>glass. "It's not that you're not enough for me. That's another phase,&nbsp;</p>
<p>another question. It's just a hunger I have inside me. If I've hurt you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry. But it's not a question of whether or not you're enough for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. I can only live with that hunger. That's the kind of man I am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what makes me me. There's nothing I can do about it, don't you&nbsp;</p>
<p>see?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last Hatsumi picked up her silverware and started eating her fish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At least you shouldn't drag Toru into your "games'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're a lot alike, though, Watanabe and me," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Neither of us is interested, essentially, in anything but ourselves. OK,&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I'm arrogant and he's not, but neither of us is able to feel any&nbsp;</p>
<p>interest in anything other than what we ourselves think or feel or do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why we can think about things in a way that's totally divorced&nbsp;</p>
<p>from anybody else. That's what I like about him. The only difference&nbsp;</p>
<p>is that he hasn't realized this about himself, and so he hesitates and&nbsp;</p>
<p>feels hurt."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What human being doesn't hesitate and feel hurt?" Hatsumi&nbsp;</p>
<p>demanded. "Are you trying to say that you have never felt those&nbsp;</p>
<p>things?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I have, but I've disciplined myself to where I can minimize&nbsp;</p>
<p>them. Even a rat will choose the least painful route if you shock him&nbsp;</p>
<p>enough."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But rats don't fall in love."&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Rats don't fall in love'." Nagasawa looked at me. "That's great. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>should have background music for this - a full orchestra with two&nbsp;</p>
<p>harps and - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't make fun of me. I'm serious." -We're eating," said Nagasawa. "And Watanabe's here. It ,night be&nbsp;</p>
<p>more civil for us to confine 'serious' talk to another occasion."&nbsp;</p>
<p>249&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can leave," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No," said Hatsumi. "Please stay. It's better with you here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At least have dessert," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't mind, really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three of us went on eating in silence for a time. I finished my fish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi left half of hers. Nagasawa had polished off his duck long&nbsp;</p>
<p>before and was now concentrating on his whisky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That was excellent sea bass," I offered, but no one took me up on it. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>might as well have thrown a rock down a deep well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The waiters took away our plates and brought lemon sherbet and&nbsp;</p>
<p>espresso. Nagasawa barely touched his dessert and coffee, moving&nbsp;</p>
<p>directly to a cigarette. Hatsumi ignored her sherbet. "Oh boy," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought to myself as I finished my sherbet and coffee. Hatsumi stared&nbsp;</p>
<p>at her hands on the table. Like everything she wore, her hands looked&nbsp;</p>
<p>chic and elegant and expensive. I thought about Naoko and Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would they be doing now? I wondered. Naoko could be lying on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sofa reading a book, and Reiko might be playing "Norwegian&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wood" on her guitar. I felt an intense desire to go back to that little&nbsp;</p>
<p>room of theirs. What the hell was I doing in this place?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where Watanabe and I are alike is, we don't give a shit if nobody&nbsp;</p>
<p>understands us," Nagasawa said. "That's what makes us different from&nbsp;</p>
<p>everybody else. They're all worried about whether the people around&nbsp;</p>
<p>them understand them. But not me, and not Watanabe. We just don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>give a shit. Self and others are separate."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is this true?" Hatsumi asked me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No," I said. "I'm not that strong. I don't feel it's OK if nobody&nbsp;</p>
<p>understands me. I've got people I want to understand and be&nbsp;</p>
<p>understood by. But aside from those few, well, I feel it's kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>hopeless. I don't agree with Nagasawa. I do care if people understand&nbsp;</p>
<p>me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's practically the same thing as what I'm saying," said Nagasawa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>picking up his coffee spoon. "It is the same! It's the difference&nbsp;</p>
<p>250&nbsp;</p>
<p>between a late breakfast or an early lunch. Same time, same food,&nbsp;</p>
<p>different name."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Hatsumi spoke to Nagasawa. "Don't you care whether I&nbsp;</p>
<p>understand you or not?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You don't get it, do you? Person A understands Person B because the&nbsp;</p>
<p>time is right for that to happen, not because Person B wants to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>understood by Person A."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So is it a mistake for me to feel that I want to be understood by&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone - by you, for example?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, it's not a mistake," answered Nagasawa. "Most people would call&nbsp;</p>
<p>that love, if you think you want to understand me. My system for&nbsp;</p>
<p>living is way different from other people's systems for living."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what you're saying is you're not in love with me, is that it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, my system and your - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To hell with your fucking system!" Hatsumi shouted. That&nbsp;</p>
<p>was the first and last time I ever heard her shout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa pushed the button by the table, and the waiter&nbsp;</p>
<p>came in with the bill. Nagasawa handed him a credit card. "Sorry&nbsp;</p>
<p>about this, Watanabe," said Nagasawa. "I'm going&nbsp;</p>
<p>to see Hatsumi home. You go back to the dorm alone, OK?" "You&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't have to apologize to me. Great meal," I said, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>no one said anything in response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The waiter brought the card, and Nagasawa signed with a ballpoint&nbsp;</p>
<p>pen after checking the amount. Then the three of us stood and went&nbsp;</p>
<p>outside. Nagasawa started to step into the street to hail a taxi, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi stopped him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks, but I don't want to spend any more time with you today. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't have to see me home. Thank you for dinner."&nbsp;</p>
<p>,,Whatever," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I want Toru to see me home."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Whatever," said Nagasawa. "But Watanabe's practically the same as&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. He may be a nice guy, but deep down in his heart he's incapable&nbsp;</p>
<p>251&nbsp;</p>
<p>of loving anybody. There's always some part of him somewhere that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>wide awake and detached. He just has that hunger that won't go away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe me, I know what I'm talking about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I flagged down a taxi and let Hatsumi in first. "Anyway," I said to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa, "I'll make sure she gets home."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry to put you through this," said Nagasawa, but I could see that he&nbsp;</p>
<p>was already thinking about something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once inside the cab, I asked Hatsumi, "Where do you want to go?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to Ebisu?" Her flat was in Ebisu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK. How about a drink somewhere?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes," she said with a nod.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Shibuya," I told the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folding her arms and closing her eyes, Hatsumi sank back into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>corner of the seat. Her small gold earrings caught the light as the taxi&nbsp;</p>
<p>swayed. Her midnight-blue dress seemed to have been made to match&nbsp;</p>
<p>the darkness of the interior. Every now and then her lightly made-up,&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautifully formed lips would quiver slightly as though she had caught&nbsp;</p>
<p>herself on the verge of talking to herself. Watching her, I could see&nbsp;</p>
<p>why Nagasawa had chosen her as his special companion. There were&nbsp;</p>
<p>any number of women more beautiful than Hatsumi, and Nagasawa&nbsp;</p>
<p>could have made any of them his. But Hatsumi had some quality that&nbsp;</p>
<p>could send a tremor through your heart. It was nothing forceful. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>power she exerted was a subtle thing, but it called forth deep&nbsp;</p>
<p>resonances. I watched her all the way to Shibuya, and wondered,&nbsp;</p>
<p>without ever finding an answer, what this emotional reverberation&nbsp;</p>
<p>could be that I was feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It finally hit me some dozen or so years later. I had gone to Santa Fe&nbsp;</p>
<p>to interview a painter and was sitting in a local pizza parlour, drinking&nbsp;</p>
<p>beer and eating pizza and watching a miraculously beautiful sunset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was soaked in brilliant red - my hand, the plate, the table,&nbsp;</p>
<p>252&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world - as if some special kind of fruit juice had splashed down on&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything. In the midst of this overwhelming sunset, the image of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi flashed into my mind, and in that moment I understood what&nbsp;</p>
<p>that tremor of the heart had been. It was a kind of childhood longing&nbsp;</p>
<p>that had always remained - and would for ever remain - unfulfilled. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had forgotten the existence of such innocent, almost burnt-in longing:&nbsp;</p>
<p>forgotten for years that such feelings had ever existed inside me. What&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi had stirred in me was a part of my very self that had long lain&nbsp;</p>
<p>dormant. And when the realization struck me, it aroused such sorrow I&nbsp;</p>
<p>almost burst into tears. She had been an absolutely special woman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone should have done something - anything - to save her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But neither Nagasawa nor I could have managed that. As so many of&nbsp;</p>
<p>those I knew had done, Hatsumi reached a certain stage in life and&nbsp;</p>
<p>decided - almost on the spur of the moment - to end it. Two years after&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa left for Germany, she married, and two years after that she&nbsp;</p>
<p>slashed her wrists with a razor blade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was Nagasawa, of course, who told me what had&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened. His letter from Bonn said this: "Hatsumi's death has&nbsp;</p>
<p>extinguished something. This is unbearably sad and painful, even to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me." I ripped his letter to shreds and threw it away. I never wrote to&nbsp;</p>
<p>him again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi and I went to a small bar and downed several drinks. Neither&nbsp;</p>
<p>of us said much. Like a bored, old married couple, we sat opposite&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other, drinking in silence and munching peanuts. When the place&nbsp;</p>
<p>began to fill up, we went for a walk. Hatsumi said she would pay the&nbsp;</p>
<p>bill, but I insisted on paying because the drinks had been my idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a deep chill in the night air. Hatsumi wrapped herself in her&nbsp;</p>
<p>pale grey cardigan and walked by my side in silence. I had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>destination in mind as we ambled through the nighttime streets, my&nbsp;</p>
<p>hands shoved deep into my pockets. This was just like walking with&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko, it occurred to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>253&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you know somewhere we could play pool around here?" Hatsumi&nbsp;</p>
<p>asked me without warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pool? You play?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm pretty good. How about you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I play a little. Not that I'm very good at it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, then. Let's go."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We found a pool hall nearby and went in. It was a small place at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>far end of an alley. The two of us - Hatsumi in her chic dress and I in&nbsp;</p>
<p>my blue blazer and regimental tie - clashed with the scruffy pool hall,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but this didn't seem to concern Hatsumi at all as she chose and chalked&nbsp;</p>
<p>her cue. She pulled a hairslide from her bag and clipped her hair aside&nbsp;</p>
<p>at one temple to keep it from interfering with her game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We played two games. Hatsumi was as good as she had claimed to be,&nbsp;</p>
<p>while my own game was hampered by the thick bandage I still wore&nbsp;</p>
<p>on my cut hand. She crushed me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're great," I said in admiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean appearances can be deceiving?" she asked as she sized up&nbsp;</p>
<p>a shot, smiling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where did you learn to play like that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My grandfather - my father's father - was an old playboy. He had a&nbsp;</p>
<p>table in his house. I used to play pool with my brother just for fun, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I got a little bigger my grandfather taught me the right moves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was a wonderful guy - stylish, handsome. He's dead now, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He always used to boast how he once met Deanna Durbin in New&nbsp;</p>
<p>York."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She got three in a row, then missed on the fourth try. I managed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>squeeze out a point, then missed an easy shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's the bandage," said Hatsumi to comfort me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, it's because I haven't played for so long," I said. "Two years and&nbsp;</p>
<p>five months."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How can you be so sure of the time?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>254&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My friend died the night after our last game together," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So you stopped playing?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, not really," I said after giving it some thought. "I just never had&nbsp;</p>
<p>the opportunity to play after that. That's all." "How did your friend&nbsp;</p>
<p>die?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Traffic accident."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She made several more shots, aiming with deadly seriousness and&nbsp;</p>
<p>adjusting the strength of each shot with precision. Watching her in&nbsp;</p>
<p>action - her carefully set hair swept back out of her eyes, golden&nbsp;</p>
<p>earrings sparkling, court shoes set firmly on the floor, lovely, slender&nbsp;</p>
<p>fingers pressing the green baize as she took her shot - I felt as if her&nbsp;</p>
<p>side of the scruffy pool hall had been transformed into part of some&nbsp;</p>
<p>elegant social event. I had never spent time with her alone before, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>this was a marvellous experience for me, as though I had been drawn&nbsp;</p>
<p>up to a higher plane of life. At the end of the third game - in which, of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course, she crushed me again -my cut began to throb, and so we&nbsp;</p>
<p>stopped playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said with what seemed like genuine concern, "I should&nbsp;</p>
<p>never have suggested this."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK," I said. "It's not a bad cut, I enjoyed playing. Really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we were leaving the pool hall, the skinny woman owner said to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi, "You've a good eye, sister." Hatsumi gave her a sweet smile&nbsp;</p>
<p>and thanked her as she paid the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Does it hurt?" she asked when we were outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not much," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you think it opened?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, it's probably OK."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know! You should come to my place. I'll change your bandage for&nbsp;</p>
<p>you. I've got disinfectant and everything. Come on, I'm right over&nbsp;</p>
<p>there."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told her it wasn't worth worrying about, that I'd be OK, but she&nbsp;</p>
<p>insisted we had to check to see if the cut had opened or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>255&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Or is it that you don't like being with me? You want to go back to&nbsp;</p>
<p>your room as soon as possible, is that it?" she said with a playful&nbsp;</p>
<p>smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All right, then. Don't stand on ceremony. It's a short walk."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi's flat was a 15-minute walk from Shibuya towards Ebisu. By&nbsp;</p>
<p>no means a glamorous building, it was more than decent, with a nice&nbsp;</p>
<p>little lobby and a lift. Hatsumi sat me at the kitchen table and went to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the bedroom to change. She came out wearing a Princeton hooded&nbsp;</p>
<p>sweatshirt and cotton trousers - and no more gold earrings. Setting a&nbsp;</p>
<p>first-aid box on the table, she undid my bandage, checked to see that&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wound was still sealed, put a little disinfectant on the area and tied&nbsp;</p>
<p>a new bandage over the cut. She did all this like an expert. "How come&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're so good at so many things?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I used to do volunteer work at a hospital. Kind of like playing nurse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's how I learned."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Hatsumi had finished with the bandage, she went and fetched&nbsp;</p>
<p>two cans of beer from the fridge. She drank half of hers, and I drank&nbsp;</p>
<p>mine plus the half she left. Then she showed me pictures of the other&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls in her club. She was right: some of them were cute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Any time you decide you want a girlfriend, come to me," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll fix you up straight away."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss."&nbsp;</p>
<p>'All right, Toru, tell me the truth. You think I'm an old matchmaker,&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To some extent," I said, telling her the truth, but with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi smiled, too. She looked good when she smiled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me something else, Toru," she said. "What do you think about&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa and me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you mean what do I think? About what?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"About what I ought to do. From now on."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter what I think," I said, taking a slug of cold beer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>256&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's all right. Tell me exactly what you think."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, if I were you, I'd leave him. I'd find someone with a more&nbsp;</p>
<p>normal way of looking at things and live happily ever after. There's no&nbsp;</p>
<p>way in hell you can be happy with him. The way he lives, it never&nbsp;</p>
<p>crosses his mind to try to make himself happy or to make others&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy. Staying with him will only wreck your nervous system. To me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's already a miracle that you've been with him three years. Of course,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm very fond of him in my own way. He's fun, and he has lots of great&nbsp;</p>
<p>qualities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has strengths and abilities that I could never hope to match. But in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the end, his ideas about things and the way he lives his life are not&nbsp;</p>
<p>normal. Sometimes, when I'm talking to him, I feel as if I'm going&nbsp;</p>
<p>around and around in circles. The same process that takes him higher&nbsp;</p>
<p>and higher leaves me going around in circles. It makes me feel so&nbsp;</p>
<p>empty! Finally, our very systems are totally different. Do you see&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I'm saying?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do," Hatsumi said as she brought me another beer from the fridge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Plus, after he gets into the Foreign Ministry and does a year of&nbsp;</p>
<p>training, he'll be going abroad. What are you going to do all that time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait for him? He has no intention of marrying anyone."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know that, too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So I've got nothing else to say."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I see," said Hatsumi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I slowly filled my glass with beer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, when we were playing pool before, something popped&nbsp;</p>
<p>into my mind," I said. "I was an only child, but all the time I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>growing up I never once felt deprived or wished I had brothers or&nbsp;</p>
<p>sisters. I was happy being alone. But all of a sudden, playing pool with&nbsp;</p>
<p>you, I had this feeling that I wished I had had an elder sister like you -&nbsp;</p>
<p>really chic and a knockout in a midnight-blue dress and gold earrings&nbsp;</p>
<p>and great with a pool cue."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi flashed me a happy smile. "That's got to be the nicest thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>257&nbsp;</p>
<p>anybody's said to me in the past year," she said. "Really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All I want for you," I said, blushing, "is for you to be happy. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>crazy, though. You seem like someone who could be happy with just&nbsp;</p>
<p>about anybody, so how did you end up with Nagasawa of all people?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Things like that just happen. There's probably not much you can do&nbsp;</p>
<p>about them. It's certainly true in my case. Of course, Nagasawa would&nbsp;</p>
<p>say it's my responsibility, not his.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sure he would."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But anyway, Toru, I'm not the smartest girl in the world. If anything,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sort of on the stupid side, and old-fashioned. I couldn't care less&nbsp;</p>
<p>about "systems' and "responsibility'. All I want is to get married and&nbsp;</p>
<p>have a man I love hold me in his arms every night and make babies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's plenty for me. It's all I want out of life."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And what Nagasawa wants out of life has nothing to do with that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"People change, though, don't you think?" Hatsumi asked. "You mean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>like, they go out into society and get a kick up the arse and grow up?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. And if he's away from me for a long time, his feelings for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>could change, don't you think?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe, if he were an ordinary guy," I said. "But he's different. He's&nbsp;</p>
<p>incredibly strong-willed - stronger than you or I can imagine. And he&nbsp;</p>
<p>only makes himself stronger with every day that goes by. If something&nbsp;</p>
<p>smashes into him, he just works to make himself stronger. He'd eat&nbsp;</p>
<p>slugs before he'd back down to anyone. What do you expect to get&nbsp;</p>
<p>from a man like that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But there's nothing I can do but wait for him," said Hatsumi with her&nbsp;</p>
<p>chin in her hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You love him that much?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do," she answered without a moment's hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh boy," I said with a sigh, drinking down the last of my beer. "It&nbsp;</p>
<p>must be a wonderful thing to be so sure that you love somebody."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm a stupid, old-fashioned girl," she said. "Have another beer?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>258&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, thanks, I must get going. Thanks for the bandage and beer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was standing in the hallway putting on my shoes, the telephone&nbsp;</p>
<p>rang. Hatsumi looked at me, looked at the phone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and looked at me again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Good night," I said, stepping outside. As I shut the door, I caught a&nbsp;</p>
<p>glimpse of Hatsumi picking up the receiver. It was the last time I ever&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was 11.30 by the time I got back to the dorm. I went straight to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa's room and knocked on his door. After the tenth knock it&nbsp;</p>
<p>occurred to me that this was Saturday night. Nagasawa always got&nbsp;</p>
<p>overnight permission on Saturday nights, supposedly to stay at his&nbsp;</p>
<p>relatives' house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to my room, took off my tie, put my jacket and trousers&nbsp;</p>
<p>on a hanger, changed into my pyjamas, and brushed my teeth. Oh no, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought, tomorrow is Sunday again! Sundays seemed to be rolling&nbsp;</p>
<p>around every four days. Another two Sundays and I would be 20 years&nbsp;</p>
<p>old. I stretched out in bed and stared at my calendar as dark feelings&nbsp;</p>
<p>washed over me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat at my desk to write my Sunday morning letter to Naoko, drinking&nbsp;</p>
<p>coffee from a big cup and listening to old Miles Davis albums. A fine&nbsp;</p>
<p>rain was falling outside, while my room had the chill of an aquarium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smell of mothballs lingered in the thick jumper I had just taken&nbsp;</p>
<p>out of a storage box. High up on the window-pane clung a huge, fat&nbsp;</p>
<p>fly, unmoving. With no wind to stir it, the Rising Sun standard hung&nbsp;</p>
<p>limp against the flagpole like the toga of a Roman senator. A skinny,&nbsp;</p>
<p>timid-looking brown dog that had wandered into the quadrangle was&nbsp;</p>
<p>sniffing every blossom in the flowerbed. I couldn't begin to imagine&nbsp;</p>
<p>why any dog would have to go around sniffing flowers on a rainy day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My letter was a long one, and whenever my cut right palm began to&nbsp;</p>
<p>hurt from holding the pen, I would let my eyes wander out to the rainy&nbsp;</p>
<p>259&nbsp;</p>
<p>quadrangle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I began by telling Naoko how I had given my right hand a nasty cut&nbsp;</p>
<p>while working in the record shop, then went on to say that Nagasawa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi and I had had a sort of celebration the night before for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa's having passed his Foreign Ministry exam. I described the&nbsp;</p>
<p>restaurant and the food. The meal was great, I said, but the atmosphere&nbsp;</p>
<p>got uncomfortable halfway through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wondered if I should write about Kizuki in connection with having&nbsp;</p>
<p>played pool with Hatsumi and decided to go ahead. I felt it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>something I ought to write about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still remember the last shot Kizuki took that day - the day he died. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a difficult cushion shot that I never expected him to get. Luck&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to be with him, though: the shot was absolutely perfect, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the white and red balls hardly made a sound as they brushed each&nbsp;</p>
<p>other on the green baize for the last score of the game. It was such a&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful shot, I still have a vivid image of it to this day. For nearly&nbsp;</p>
<p>two-and-a-half years after that, I never touched a cue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night I played pool with Hatsumi, though, the thought of Kizuki&nbsp;</p>
<p>never crossed my mind until the first game ended, and this came as a&nbsp;</p>
<p>real shock to me. I had always assumed that I'd be reminded of Kizuki&nbsp;</p>
<p>whenever I played pool. But not until the first game was over and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>bought a Pepsi from a vending machine and started drinking it did I&nbsp;</p>
<p>even think of him. It was the pool hall we used to play in, and we had&nbsp;</p>
<p>often bet drinks on the outcome of our games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt guilty that I hadn't thought of Kizuki straight away, as if I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>somehow abandoned him. Back in my room, though, I came to think&nbsp;</p>
<p>of it like this: two and-a-half years have gone by since it happened,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Kizuki is still 17 years old. Not that this means my memory of&nbsp;</p>
<p>him has faded. The things that his death gave rise to are still there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>bright and clear, inside me, some of them even clearer than when they&nbsp;</p>
<p>were new. What I want to say is this: I'm going to turn 20 soon. Part of&nbsp;</p>
<p>260&nbsp;</p>
<p>what Kizuki and I shared when we were 16 and 17 has already&nbsp;</p>
<p>vanished, and no amount of crying is going to bring that back. I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>explain it any better than this, but I think that you can probably under</p>
<p>stand what I felt and what I am trying to say. In fact, you are probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only one in the world who can understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of you now more than ever. It's raining today. Rainy Sundays&nbsp;</p>
<p>are hard for me. When it rains I can't do laundry, which means I can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>do ironing. I can't go walking, and I can't lie on the roof. About all I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can do is put the record player on auto repeat and listen to Kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue over and over while I watch the rain falling in the quadrangle. As&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote to you earlier, I don't wind my spring on Sundays. That's why&nbsp;</p>
<p>this letter is so damn long. I'm stopping now. I'm going to the dining&nbsp;</p>
<p>hall for lunch. Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>261&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no sign of Midori at the next day's lecture, either. What had&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened to her? Ten days had gone by since we last talked on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>phone. I thought about calling her, but decided against it. She had said&nbsp;</p>
<p>that she would call me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That Thursday I saw Nagasawa in the dining hall. He sat down next to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me with a tray full of food and apologized for having made our&nbsp;</p>
<p>"party" so unpleasant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never mind," I said. "I should be thanking you for a great dinner. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to admit, though, it was a funny way to celebrate your first job."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can say that again."&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few minutes went by as we ate in silence. "I made up with&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was kind of tough on you, too, as I recall it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's with all the apologizing?" I asked. "Are you ill?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I may be," he said with a few little nods. "Hatsumi tells me you told&nbsp;</p>
<p>her to leave me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It only makes sense," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I s'pose so," said Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's a great girl," I said, slurping my miso soup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know," he said with a sigh. "A little too great for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was sleeping the sleep of death when the buzzer rang to let me know&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a call. It brought me back from the absolute core of sleep in total&nbsp;</p>
<p>262&nbsp;</p>
<p>confusion. I felt as if I had been sleeping with my head soaked in&nbsp;</p>
<p>water until my brain swelled up. The clock said 6.15 but I had no idea&nbsp;</p>
<p>if that meant a.m. or p.m., and I couldn't remember what day it was. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>looked out of the window and realized there was no flag on the pole. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>was probably p.m. So, raising that flag served some purpose after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, are you free now?" Midori asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, what day is it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Friday."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Morning or evening?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Evening, of course! You're so weird! Let's see, it's, uh, 6.18 p.m."&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it was p.m. after all! That's right, I had been stretched out on my&nbsp;</p>
<p>bed reading a book when I dozed off. Friday. My head started&nbsp;</p>
<p>working. I didn't have to go to the record shop on Friday nights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm free. Where are you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ueno Station. Why don't you meet me in Shinjuku? I'll leave now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We set a time and place and hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I got to DUG, Midori was sitting at the far end of the counter&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a drink. She wore a man's wrinkled, white balmacaan coat, a thin&nbsp;</p>
<p>yellow jumper, blue jeans, and two bracelets on one wrist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What're you drinking?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tom Collins."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ordered a whisky and soda, then realized there was a big suitcase by&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went away," she said. "Just got back."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where'd you go?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"South to Nara and north to Aomori."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"On the same trip?!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be stupid. I may be strange, but I can't go north and south at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>same time. I went to Nara with my boyfriend, and then took off to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aomori alone."&nbsp;</p>
<p>263&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sipped my whisky and soda, then struck a match to light the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marlboro that Midori held between her lips. "You must have had a&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible time, what with the funeral and everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, a funeral's a piece of cake. We've had plenty of practice. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>put on a black kimono and sit there like a lady and everybody else&nbsp;</p>
<p>takes care of business - an uncle, a neighbour, like that. They bring the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sake, order the sushi, say comforting things, cry, carry on, divide up&nbsp;</p>
<p>the keepsakes. It's a breeze. A picnic. Compared to nursing someone&nbsp;</p>
<p>day after day, it's an absolute picnic. We were drained, my sister and&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. We couldn't even cry. We didn't have any tears left. Really.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except, when you do that, they start whispering about you: "Those&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls are as cold as ice.' So then, we're never going to cry, that's just&nbsp;</p>
<p>how the two of us are. I know we could have faked it, but we would&nbsp;</p>
<p>never do anything like that. The bastards! The more they wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>see us cry, the more determined we were not to give them the&nbsp;</p>
<p>satisfaction. My sister and I are totally different types, but when it&nbsp;</p>
<p>comes to something like that, we're in absolute sync."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's bracelets jangled on her arm as she waved to the waiter and&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordered another Tom Collins and a small bowl of pistachios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So then, after the funeral ended and everybody went home, the two of&nbsp;</p>
<p>us drank sake till the sun went down. Polished off one of those huge&nbsp;</p>
<p>half-gallon bottles, and half of another one, and the whole time we&nbsp;</p>
<p>were dumping on everybody -&nbsp;</p>
<p>this one's an idiot, that one's a shithead, one guy looks like a mangy&nbsp;</p>
<p>dog, another one's a pig, so-and-so's a hypocrite, that one's a crook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have no idea how great it felt!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can imagine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We got pissed and went to bed - both of us out cold. We slept for&nbsp;</p>
<p>hours, and if the phone rang or something, we just let it go. Dead to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the world. Finally, after we woke up, we ordered sushi and talked&nbsp;</p>
<p>about what to do. We decided to close the shop for a while and enjoy&nbsp;</p>
<p>ourselves. We'd been killing ourselves for months and we deserved a&nbsp;</p>
<p>264&nbsp;</p>
<p>break. My sister just wanted to hang around with her boyfriend for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>while, and I decided I'd take mine on a trip for a couple of days and&nbsp;</p>
<p>fuck like crazy." Midori clamped her mouth shut and rubbed her ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oops, sorry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's OK," I said. "So you went to Nara."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've always liked that place. The temples, the deer park."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And did you fuck like crazy?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, not at all, not even once," she said with a sigh. "The second we&nbsp;</p>
<p>walked into the hotel room and dumped our bags, my period started. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>real gusher."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't help laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, it's not funny. I was a week early! I couldn't stop crying when&nbsp;</p>
<p>that happened. I think all the stress threw me off. My boyfriend got&nbsp;</p>
<p>sooo angry! He's like that: he gets angry straight away. It wasn't my&nbsp;</p>
<p>fault, though. It's not like I wanted to get my period. And, well, mine&nbsp;</p>
<p>are kind of on the heavy side anyway. The first day or two, I don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to do anything. Make sure you keep away from me then."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like to, but how can I tell?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, I'll wear a hat for a couple of days after my period starts. A red&nbsp;</p>
<p>one. That should work," she said with a laugh "If you see me on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>street and I'm wearing a red hat, don't talk to me, just run away."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great. I wish all girls would do that," I said. "So anyway what did&nbsp;</p>
<p>you do in Nara?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What else could we do? We fed the deer and walked all over the&nbsp;</p>
<p>place. It was just awful! We had a big fight and I haven't seen him&nbsp;</p>
<p>since we got back. I hung around for a couple of days and decided to&nbsp;</p>
<p>take a nice trip all by myself. So I went to Aomori. I stayed with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>friend in Hirosaki for the first two nights, and then I started travelling&nbsp;</p>
<p>around - Shimokita, Tappi, places like that. They're nice. I once wrote&nbsp;</p>
<p>a map brochure for the area. Ever been there?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So anyway," said Midori, sipping her Tom Collins, then wrenching&nbsp;</p>
<p>265&nbsp;</p>
<p>open a pistachio, "the whole time I was travelling by myself, I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>thinking of you. I was thinking how nice it would be if I could have&nbsp;</p>
<p>you with me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How come?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How come?!" Midori looked at me with eyes focused on nothingness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you mean "How come?'?!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just that. How come you were thinking of me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe because I like you, that's how come! Why else would I be&nbsp;</p>
<p>thinking of you? Who would ever think they wanted to be with&nbsp;</p>
<p>somebody they didn't like?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you've got a boyfriend," I said. "You don't have to think about&nbsp;</p>
<p>me." I took a slow sip of my whisky and soda. "Meaning I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>allowed to think about you if I've got a boyfriend?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, that's not it, I just - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now get this straight, Watanabe," said Midori, pointing at me. "I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>warning you, I've got a whole month's worth of misery crammed&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside me and getting ready to blow. So watch what you say to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more of that kind of stuff and I'll flood this place with tears. Once&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get started, I'm good for the whole night. Are you ready for that? I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>an absolute animal when I start crying, it doesn't matter where I am!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not joking."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded and kept quiet. I ordered a second whisky and soda and ate a&nbsp;</p>
<p>few pistachios. Somewhere behind the sound of a sloshing shaker and&nbsp;</p>
<p>clinking glasses and the scrape of an ice maker, Sarah Vaughan sang&nbsp;</p>
<p>an old-fashioned love song.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Things haven't been right between me and my boyfriend ever since&nbsp;</p>
<p>the tampon incident."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tampon incident?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was out drinking with him and a few of his friends about a&nbsp;</p>
<p>month ago and I told them the story of a woman in my neighbourhood&nbsp;</p>
<p>who blew out a tampon when she sneezed. Funny, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That is funny," I said with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>266&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, all the other guys thought so, too. But he got mad and said I&nbsp;</p>
<p>shouldn't be talking about such dirty things. Such a wet blanket!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wow."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's a wonderful guy, but he can be really narrow-minded when it&nbsp;</p>
<p>comes to stuff like that," said Midori. "Like, he gets mad if I wear&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything but white underwear. Don't you think that's narrow-minded?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe so," I said, "but it's just a matter of taste." It seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>incredible to me that a guy like that would want a girlfriend like&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori, but I kept this thought to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, what have you been doing?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing. Same as ever," I said, but then I recalled my attempt to&nbsp;</p>
<p>masturbate while thinking of Midori as I had promised to do. I told her&nbsp;</p>
<p>about it in a low voice that wouldn't carry to the others around us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's eyes lit up and she snapped her fingers. "How'd it go? Was it&nbsp;</p>
<p>good?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, I got embarrassed halfway through and stopped." "You mean&nbsp;</p>
<p>you lost your erection?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pretty much."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Damn," she said, shooting a look of annoyance at me. "You can't let&nbsp;</p>
<p>yourself get embarrassed. Think about something really sexy. It's OK,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm giving you permission. Hey, I know what! Next time I'll get on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>phone with you: "Oh, oh, that's great ... Oh, I feel it ... Stop, I'm gonna&nbsp;</p>
<p>come ... Oh, don't do that!' I'll say stuff like that to you while you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>doing it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The dormitory phone is in the lobby by the front door, with people&nbsp;</p>
<p>coming in and out all the time," I explained. "The dorm Head would&nbsp;</p>
<p>kill me with his bare hands if he saw me wanking in a place like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, too bad."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never mind," I said. "I'll try again by myself one of these days."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Give it your best shot," said Midori. "I will," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder if it's me," she said. "Maybe I'm just not Innately."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's not it," I assured her. "It's more a question of attitude."&nbsp;</p>
<p>267&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know," she said, "I have this tremendously sensitive back. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>soft touch of fingers all over ... mmmmm." "I'll keep that in mind."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, why don't we go now and see a dirty film?" Midori suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A really filthy S&amp;M one."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went from the bar to an eel shop, and from there to one of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shinjuku's most run-down adult cinemas to see a triple bill. It was the&nbsp;</p>
<p>only place we could find in the paper that was showing S&amp;M stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside, the cinema had some kind of indefinable smell. Our timing&nbsp;</p>
<p>was good: the S&amp;M film was just starting as we took our seats. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>the story of a secretary and her schoolgirl sister being kidnapped by a&nbsp;</p>
<p>bunch of men and subjected to sadistic tortures. The men made the&nbsp;</p>
<p>older one to do all kinds of awful things by threatening to rape the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sister, but soon the older sister is transformed into a raging masochist,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the younger one gets really turned on from having to watch all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>contortions they put her through. It was such a gloomy, repetitive film,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got bored after a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If I were the younger sister, I wouldn't get worked up so easily," said&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori. "I'd keep watching."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sure you would," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And anyway, don't you think her nipples are too dark for a schoolgirl - a virgin?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Absolutely."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori's eyes were glued to the screen. I was impressed: anyone&nbsp;</p>
<p>watching a film with such fierce intensity was getting more than her&nbsp;</p>
<p>money's worth. She kept reporting her thoughts to me: "Oh my God,&nbsp;</p>
<p>will you look at that!" or "Three guys at once! They're going to tear&nbsp;</p>
<p>her apart!" or "I'd like to try that on somebody, Watanabe." I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoying Midori a lot more than the film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the lights went up during the intermission, I realized there were&nbsp;</p>
<p>no other women in the place. One young man sitting near us -&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably a student - took one look at Midori and changed his seat to&nbsp;</p>
<p>268&nbsp;</p>
<p>the far side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, Watanabe, do you get hard watching this kind of stuff?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, yeah, sometimes," I said. "That's why they make these films."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what you're saying is, every time one of those scenes starts, every&nbsp;</p>
<p>man in the cinema has his thing standing to attention? Thirty or forty&nbsp;</p>
<p>of them sticking up all at once? It's so weird if you stop and think&nbsp;</p>
<p>about it, don't you think?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess so, now you mention it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second feature was a fairly normal porn flick, which meant it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>even more boring than the first. It had lots of oral sex scenes, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>every time they started doing fellatio or cunnilingus or sixty-nine the&nbsp;</p>
<p>soundtrack would fill the cinema with loud sucking or slurping sound&nbsp;</p>
<p>effects. Listening to them, I felt strangely moved to think that I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>living out my life on this bizarre planet of ours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Who comes up with these sounds, I wonder," I said to Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think they're great!" she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was also a sound for a penis moving in and out of a vagina. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had never realized that such sounds even existed. The man was into a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot of heavy breathing, and the woman came up with the usual sort of&nbsp;</p>
<p>expressions - "Yes!" or "More!" - as she writhed under him. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>could also hear the bed creaking. These scenes just went on and on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori seemed to be enjoying them at first, but even she got bored&nbsp;</p>
<p>after a while and suggested we leave. We went outside and took a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>deep breaths. This was the first time in my life the outside air of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shinjuku felt healthy to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That was fun," said Midori. "Let's try it again sometime."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They just keep doing the same things," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, what else can they do? We all just keep doing the same things."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had a point there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We found another bar and ordered drinks. I had more whisky, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori drank three or four cocktails of some indefinable kind. Outside&nbsp;</p>
<p>again, Midori said she wanted to climb a tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>269&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There aren't any trees around here," I said. "And even if there were,&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're too wobbly to do any climbing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're always so damn sensible, you ruin everything. I'm drunk&nbsp;</p>
<p>'cause I wanna be drunk. What's wrong with that? And even if I am&nbsp;</p>
<p>drunk, I can still climb a tree. Shit, I'm gonna climb all the way to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>top of a great, big, tall tree and I'm gonna pee all over everybody!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You wouldn't happen to need the toilet by any chance?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took Midori to a pay toilet in Shinjuku Station, put a coin in the slot&nbsp;</p>
<p>and bundled her inside, then bought an evening paper at a nearby&nbsp;</p>
<p>stand and read it while I waited for her to come out. But she didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>come out. I started getting worried after 15 minutes and was ready to&nbsp;</p>
<p>go and check on her when she finally emerged looking pale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said. "I fell asleep."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" I asked, putting my coat around her shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not really," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll take you home. You just have to get home, take a nice, long bath&nbsp;</p>
<p>and go to bed. You're exhausted."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I am not going home. What's the point? Nobody's there. I don't want&nbsp;</p>
<p>to sleep all by myself in a place like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Terrific," I said. "So what are you going to do?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Go to some love hotel around here and sleep with your arms around&nbsp;</p>
<p>me all night. Like a log. Tomorrow morning we'll have breakfast&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhere and go to lectures together."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You were planning this all along, weren't you? That's why you called&nbsp;</p>
<p>me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You should have called your boyfriend, not me. That's the only thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>that makes sense. That's what boyfriends are for."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I want to be with you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't be with me," I said. "First of all, I have to be back in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm by midnight. Otherwise, I'll break curfew. The one time I did&nbsp;</p>
<p>270&nbsp;</p>
<p>that there was all hell to pay. And secondly, if I go to bed with a girl,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to want to do it with her, and the last thing I want is to lie&nbsp;</p>
<p>there struggling to restrain myself. I'm not kidding, I might end up&nbsp;</p>
<p>forcing you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean you'd hit me and tie me up and rape me from behind?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, look, I'm serious."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I'm so lonely! I want to be with someone! I know I'm doing&nbsp;</p>
<p>terrible things to you, making demands and not giving you anything in&nbsp;</p>
<p>return, saying whatever pops into my head, dragging you out of your&nbsp;</p>
<p>room and forcing you to take me everywhere, but you're the only one I&nbsp;</p>
<p>can do stuff like that to! I've never been able to have my own way&nbsp;</p>
<p>with anybody, not once in the 20 years I've been alive. My father, my&nbsp;</p>
<p>mother, they never paid the slightest attention to me, and my&nbsp;</p>
<p>boyfriend, well, he's just not that kind of guy. He gets angry if I try to&nbsp;</p>
<p>have my own way. So we end up fighting. You're the only one I can&nbsp;</p>
<p>say these things to. And now I'm really, really, really tired and I want&nbsp;</p>
<p>to fall asleep listening to someone tell me how much they like me and&nbsp;</p>
<p>how pretty I am and stuff. That's all I want. And when I wake up, I'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>be full of energy and I'll never make these kinds of selfish demands&nbsp;</p>
<p>again. I swear. I'll be a good girl."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hear you, believe me, but there's nothing I can do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, please! Otherwise, I'm going to sit down right here on the ground&nbsp;</p>
<p>and cry my head off all night long. And I'll sleep with the first guy that&nbsp;</p>
<p>talks to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>That did it. I called the dorm and asked for Nagasawa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he got to the phone I asked him if he would make it look as if I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had come back for the evening. I was with a girl, I explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," he said. "It's a worthy cause, I'll be glad to help you out. I'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>just turn over your name tag to the "in' side. Don't worry. Take all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>time you need. You can come in through my window in the morning."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks. I owe you one," I said and hung up. "All set?" Midori asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pretty much," I said with a sigh. "Great, let's go to a disco, it's so&nbsp;</p>
<p>271&nbsp;</p>
<p>early." "Wait a minute, I thought you were tired." "For something like&nbsp;</p>
<p>this, I'm just fine." "Oh boy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And she was right. We went to a disco, and her energy came back&nbsp;</p>
<p>little by little as we danced. She drank two whisky and cokes, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>stayed on the dance floor until her forehead was drenched in sweat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is so much fun!" she exclaimed when we took a break at a table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I haven't danced like this in ages. I don't know, when you move your&nbsp;</p>
<p>body, it's kind of like your spirit gets liberated."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your spirit is always liberated, I'd say."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," she said, shaking her head and smiling. "Anyway, now that&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm feeling better, I'm starved! Let's go for a pizza."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took her to a pizzeria I knew and ordered draught beer and an&nbsp;</p>
<p>anchovy pizza. I wasn't very hungry and ate only four of the twelve&nbsp;</p>
<p>slices. Midori finished the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You sure made a fast recovery," I said. "Not too long ago you were&nbsp;</p>
<p>pale and wobbly."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's because my selfish demands got through to somebody,,, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>answered. "It unclogged me. Wow, this pizza is great!',&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, though. Is there really nobody at home?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true. My sister's staying at her friend's place. Now, that girl's got&nbsp;</p>
<p>a real case of the creeps. She can't sleep alone in the house if I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>there."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's forget this love hotel crap, then. Going to a place like that just&nbsp;</p>
<p>makes you feel cheap. Let's go to your house. You must have enough&nbsp;</p>
<p>bedding for me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori thought about it for a minute, then nodded. "OK, we'll spend&nbsp;</p>
<p>the night at mine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took the Yamanote Line to Otsuka, and soon we were raising the&nbsp;</p>
<p>metal shutter that sealed off the front of the Kobayashi Bookshop. A&nbsp;</p>
<p>paper sign on the shutter read TEMPORARILY CLOSED. The smell&nbsp;</p>
<p>of old paper filled the dark shop, as if the shutter had not been opened&nbsp;</p>
<p>for a long time. Half the shelves were empty, and most of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>272&nbsp;</p>
<p>magazines had been tied in bundles for returns. That hollow, chilly&nbsp;</p>
<p>feeling I had experienced on my first visit had only deepened. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>place looked like a hulk abandoned on the shore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're not planning to open shop again?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, we're going to sell it," said Midori. "We'll divide the money and&nbsp;</p>
<p>live on our own for a while without anybody's "protection'. My sister's&nbsp;</p>
<p>getting married next year, and I've got three more years at university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ought to make enough to see us through that much at least. I'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep my part-time job, too. Once the place is sold, I'll live with my&nbsp;</p>
<p>sister in a flat for a while."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You think somebody'll want to buy it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Probably. I know somebody who wants to open a wool shop, She's&nbsp;</p>
<p>been asking me recently if I want to sell. Poor Dad, though. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>worked so hard to get this place, and he was paying off the loan he&nbsp;</p>
<p>took out little by little, and in the end he hardly had anything left. It all&nbsp;</p>
<p>melted away, like foam on a river."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He had you, though," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Me?!" Midori said with a laugh. She took a deep breath and let it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's go upstairs. It's cold down here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upstairs, she sat me at the kitchen table and went to warm the bath&nbsp;</p>
<p>water. While she busied herself with that, I put a kettle on to boil and&nbsp;</p>
<p>made tea. Waiting for the tank to heat up, we sat across from each&nbsp;</p>
<p>other at the kitchen table and drank tea. Chin in hand, she took a long,&nbsp;</p>
<p>hard look at me. There were no sounds other than the ticking of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>clock and the hum of the fridge motor turning on and off as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>thermostat kicked in and out. The clock showed that midnight was fast&nbsp;</p>
<p>approaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, Watanabe, study it hard enough, and you've got a pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>interesting face."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Think so?" I asked, a bit hurt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A nice face goes a long way with me," she said. "And yours ... well,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the more I look at it, the more I get to thinking, "He'll do'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>273&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Me, too," I said. "Every once in a while, I think about myself, "What&nbsp;</p>
<p>the hell, I'll do'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm not very good at putting my&nbsp;</p>
<p>feelings into words. That's why people misunderstand me. All I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>trying to say is I like you. Have I told you that before?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I mean, I'm not the only one who has trouble working out what men&nbsp;</p>
<p>are all about. But I'm getting there, a little at a time."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori brought over a box of Marlboro and lit one up. "When you&nbsp;</p>
<p>start at zero, you've got a lot to learn." "I wouldn't be surprised."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, I almost forgot! You want to burn a stick of incense for my&nbsp;</p>
<p>father?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed Midori to the room with the Buddhist altar, lit a stick of&nbsp;</p>
<p>incense in front of her father's photo, and brought my hands together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Know what I did the other day?" Midori asked. "I got all naked in&nbsp;</p>
<p>front of my father's picture. Took off every stitch of clothing and let&nbsp;</p>
<p>him have a good, long look. Kind of in a yoga position. Like, "Here,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daddy, these are my tits, and this is my cunt'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why in the hell would you do something like that?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know, I just wanted to show him. I mean, half of me comes&nbsp;</p>
<p>from his sperm, right? Why shouldn't I show him? "Here's the&nbsp;</p>
<p>daughter you made.' I was a little drunk at the time. I suppose that had&nbsp;</p>
<p>something to do with it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My sister walked in and almost fell over. There I was in front of my&nbsp;</p>
<p>father's memorial portrait all naked with my legs spread. I guess you&nbsp;</p>
<p>would be kind of surprised." "I s'pose so."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I explained why I was doing it and said, "So take off your clothes too&nbsp;</p>
<p>Momo (her name's Momo), and sit down next to me and show him,'&nbsp;</p>
<p>but she wouldn't do it. She went away shocked. She has this really&nbsp;</p>
<p>conservative streak."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"In other words, she's relatively normal, you mean."&nbsp;</p>
<p>274&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, Watanabe, what did you think of my father?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not good with people I've just met, but it didn't bother me being&nbsp;</p>
<p>alone with him. I felt pretty comfortable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We talked about all kinds of stuff." -What kind of stuff?" -Euripides," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori laughed out loud. "You're so weird! Nobody talks about&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euripides with a dying person they've just met!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>,,Well, nobody sits in front of her father's memorial portrait with her&nbsp;</p>
<p>legs spread, either!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori chuckled and gave the altar bell a ring. "Night-night, Daddy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're going to have some fun now, so don't worry and get some sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're not suffering any more, right? You're dead, OK? I'm sure&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're not suffering. If you are, you'd better complain to the gods. Tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>'em it's just too cruel. I hope you meet Mum and the two of you really&nbsp;</p>
<p>do it. I saw your willy when I helped you pee. It was pretty&nbsp;</p>
<p>impressive! So give it everything you've got. Goodnight."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took turns in the bath and changed into pyjamas. I borrowed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>nearly new pair of her father's. They were a little small but better than&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing. Midori spread out a mattress for me on the floor of the altar&nbsp;</p>
<p>room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're not scared sleeping in front of the altar?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all. I haven't done anything bad," I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you're going to stay with me and hold me until I fall asleep,&nbsp;</p>
<p>right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practically falling over the edge of Midori's little bed, I held her in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>arms. Nose against my chest, she placed her hands on my hips. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>right arm curled around her back while I tried to keep from falling out&nbsp;</p>
<p>by hanging on to the bed frame with my left hand. It was not exactly a&nbsp;</p>
<p>275&nbsp;</p>
<p>situation conducive to sexual excitement. My nose was resting on her&nbsp;</p>
<p>head and her short-cut hair would tickle every now and then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come on, say something to me," Midori said, her face buried in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you want me to say?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Anything. Something to make me feel good." "You're really cute," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>" - Midori," she said. "Say my name."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're really cute, Midori," I corrected myself. "What do you mean&nbsp;</p>
<p>really cute?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So cute the mountains crumble and the oceans dry up." Midori lifted&nbsp;</p>
<p>her face and looked at me. "You have this special way with words."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can feel my heart softening when you say that," I said, smiling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Say something even nicer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really like you, Midori. A lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How much is a lot?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like a spring bear," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A spring bear?" Midori looked up again. "What's that all about? A&nbsp;</p>
<p>spring bear."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're walking through a field all by yourself one day in spring, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>this sweet little bear cub with velvet fur and shiny little eyes comes&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking along. And he says to you, "Hi, there, little lady. Want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>tumble with me?' So you and the bear cub spend the whole day in each&nbsp;</p>
<p>other's arms, tumbling down this clover-covered hill. Nice, huh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah. Really nice."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's how much I like you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That is the best thing I've ever heard," said Midori, cuddling up&nbsp;</p>
<p>against my chest. "If you like me that much, you'll do anything I tell&nbsp;</p>
<p>you to do, right? You won't get angry, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, of course not."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you'll take care of me always and always."&nbsp;</p>
<p>,,Of course I will," I said, stroking her short, soft, boyish hair. "Don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>276&nbsp;</p>
<p>worry, everything is going to be fine."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I'm scared," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I held her softly, and soon her shoulders were rising and falling, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could hear the regular breathing of sleep. I slipped out of her bed and&nbsp;</p>
<p>went to the kitchen, where I drank a beer. I wasn't the least bit sleepy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I thought about reading a book, but I couldn't find anything worth&nbsp;</p>
<p>reading nearby. I considered returning to Midori's room to look for&nbsp;</p>
<p>one, but I didn't want to wake her by rummaging around while she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was sleeping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat there staring into space for a while, sipping my beer, when it&nbsp;</p>
<p>occurred to me that I was in a bookshop. I went downstairs, switched&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the light and started looking through the paperback shelves. There&nbsp;</p>
<p>wasn't much that appealed to me, and most of what did I had read&nbsp;</p>
<p>already, but I had to have something to read no matter what. I picked a&nbsp;</p>
<p>discoloured copy of Hermann Hesse's Beneath the Wheel that must&nbsp;</p>
<p>have been hanging around the shop unsold for a long time, and left the&nbsp;</p>
<p>money for it by the till. This was my small contribution to reducing&nbsp;</p>
<p>the debts of the Kobayashi Bookshop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat at the kitchen table, drinking my beer and reading Beneath the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wheel. I had first read the novel the year I entered school. And now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>about eight years later, here I was, reading the same book in a girl's&nbsp;</p>
<p>kitchen, wearing the undersized pyjamas of her dead father. Funny. If&nbsp;</p>
<p>it hadn't been for these strange circumstances, I would probably never&nbsp;</p>
<p>have reread&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beneath the Wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book did have its dated moments, but as a novel it wasn't bad. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>moved through it slowly, enjoying it line by line, in the hushed&nbsp;</p>
<p>bookshop in the middle of the night. A dusty bottle of brandy stood on&nbsp;</p>
<p>a shelf in the kitchen. I poured a little into a coffee cup and sipped it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It warmed me but did nothing to help me feel sleepy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to check on Midori a little before three, but she was fast asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She must have been exhausted. The lights from the block of shops&nbsp;</p>
<p>277&nbsp;</p>
<p>beyond the window cast a soft white glow, like moonlight, over the&nbsp;</p>
<p>room. Midori slept with her back to the light. She lay so perfectly still,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she might have been frozen stiff. Bending over, I caught the sound of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her breathing. She slept just like her father.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suitcase from her recent travels stood by the bed. Her white coat&nbsp;</p>
<p>hung on the back of a chair. Her desktop was neatly arranged, and on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wall over it hung a Snoopy calendar. I nudged the curtain aside&nbsp;</p>
<p>and looked down at the deserted shops. Every shop was closed, their&nbsp;</p>
<p>metal shutters down, the vending machines hunched in front of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>off-licence the only sign of something waiting for the dawn. The moan&nbsp;</p>
<p>of longdistance lorry tyres sent a deep shudder through the air every&nbsp;</p>
<p>now and then. I went back to the kitchen, poured myself another shot&nbsp;</p>
<p>of brandy, and went on reading Beneath the Wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time I had finished it the sky was growing light. I made myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>some instant coffee and used some notepaper and a ballpoint pen I&nbsp;</p>
<p>found on the table to write a message to Midori: I drank some of your&nbsp;</p>
<p>brandy. I bought a copy of Beneath the Wheel. It's light outside, so I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>going home. Goodbye. Then, after some hesitation, I wrote: You look&nbsp;</p>
<p>really cute when you're sleeping. I washed my coffee cup, switched&nbsp;</p>
<p>off the kitchen light, went downstairs, quietly lifted the shutter, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>stepped outside. I worried that a neighbour might find me suspicious,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but there was no one on the street at 5.50-something in the morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the crows were on their usual rooftop perch, glaring down at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>street. I glanced up at the pale pink curtains in Midori's window,&nbsp;</p>
<p>walked to the tram stop, rode to the end of the line, and walked to my&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm. On the way I found an open cafe and ate a breakfast of rice and&nbsp;</p>
<p>miso soup, pickled vegetables and fried eggs. Circling around to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>back of the dorm, I tapped on Nagasawa's ground-floor window. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>let me in immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Coffee?" he asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thanked him, went up to my room, brushed my teeth, took my&nbsp;</p>
<p>278&nbsp;</p>
<p>trousers off, got under the covers, and clamped my eyes shut. Finally,&nbsp;</p>
<p>a dreamless sleep closed over me like a heavy lead door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote to Naoko every week, and she often wrote back. Her letters&nbsp;</p>
<p>were never very long. Soon there were references to the cold&nbsp;</p>
<p>November mornings and evenings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You went back to Tokyo just about the time the autumn weather was&nbsp;</p>
<p>deepening, so for a time I couldn't tell whether the hole that opened up&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside me was from missing you or from the change of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko and I talk about you all the time. She says be sure to say "Hi" to&nbsp;</p>
<p>you. She is as nice to me as ever. I don't think I would have been able&nbsp;</p>
<p>to stand this place if I didn't have her with me. I cry when I'm lonely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko says it's good I can cry. But feeling lonely really hurts. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm lonely at night, people talk to me from the darkness. They talk to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me the way trees moan in the wind at night. Kizuki; my sister: they&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk to me like that all the time. They're lonely, too, and looking for&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone to talk to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often reread your letters at night when I'm lonely and in pain. I get&nbsp;</p>
<p>confused by a lot of things that come from outside, but your&nbsp;</p>
<p>descriptions of the world around you give me wonderful relief. It's so&nbsp;</p>
<p>strange! I wonder why that should be? So I read them over and over,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Reiko reads them, too. Then we talk about the things you tell me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really liked the part about that girl Midori's father. We look forward&nbsp;</p>
<p>to getting your letter every week as one of our few entertainments -&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes, in a place like this, letters are our entertainments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try my best to set aside a time in the week for writing to you, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>once I actually sit down in front of the blank sheet of paper, I begin to&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel depressed. I'm really having to push myself to write this letter,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too. Reiko's been yelling at me to answer you. Don't get me wrong,&nbsp;</p>
<p>though. I have tons of things I want to talk to you about, to tell you&nbsp;</p>
<p>about. It's just hard for me to put them into words. Which is why it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>279&nbsp;</p>
<p>so painful for me to write letters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of Midori, she sounds like an interesting person. Reading&nbsp;</p>
<p>your letter, I got the feeling she might be in love with you. When I&nbsp;</p>
<p>told that to Reiko, she said, "Well, of course she is! Even I am in love&nbsp;</p>
<p>with Watanabe!' We're picking mushrooms and gathering chestnuts&nbsp;</p>
<p>and eating them every day. And I do mean every day: rice with&nbsp;</p>
<p>chestnuts, rice with matsutake mushrooms, but they taste so great, we&nbsp;</p>
<p>never get tired of them. Reiko doesn't eat that much, though. For her,&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's still one cigarette after another. The birds and the rabbits are doing&nbsp;</p>
<p>fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three days after my twentieth birthday, a package arrived for me from&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko. Inside I found a wine-coloured crew neck pullover and a&nbsp;</p>
<p>letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Birthday! I hope you have a happy year being 20. My own year&nbsp;</p>
<p>of being 20 looks like it's going to end with me as miserable as ever,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I'd really like it if you could have your share of happiness and&nbsp;</p>
<p>mine combined. Really. Reiko and I each knitted half of this jumper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had done it all by myself, it would have taken until next&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valentine's Day. The good half is Reiko's, and the bad half is mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko is so good at everything she does, I sometimes hate myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I'm watching her. I mean, there's not a single thing I'm really&nbsp;</p>
<p>good at!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The package had a short note from Reiko, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are you? For you, Naoko may be the pinnacle of happiness, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>for me she's just a clumsy girl. Still, we managed to finish this jumper&nbsp;</p>
<p>in time for your birthday. Handsome, isn't it? We chose the colour and&nbsp;</p>
<p>280&nbsp;</p>
<p>the style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Birthday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>281&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking back on the year 1969, all that comes to mind for me is a&nbsp;</p>
<p>swamp - a deep, sticky bog that feels as if it's going to suck off my&nbsp;</p>
<p>shoe each time I take a step. I walk through the mud, exhausted. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>front of me, behind me, I can see nothing but the endless darkness of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>swamp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time itself slogged along in rhythm with my faltering steps. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>people around me had gone on ahead long before, while my time and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>hung back, struggling through the mud. The world around me was on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the verge of great transformations. Death had already taken John&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coltrane who was joined now by so many others. People screamed&nbsp;</p>
<p>there'd be revolutionary changes - which always seemed to be just&nbsp;</p>
<p>ahead, at the curve in the road. But the "changes" that came were just&nbsp;</p>
<p>two-dimensional stage sets, backdrops without substance or meaning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I trudged along through each day in its turn, rarely looking up, eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>locked on the never-ending swamp that lay before me, planting my&nbsp;</p>
<p>right foot, raising my left, planting my left foot, raising my right,&nbsp;</p>
<p>never sure where I was, never sure I was headed in the right direction,&nbsp;</p>
<p>knowing only that I had to keep moving, one step at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned 20, autumn gave way to winter, but in my life nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>changed in any significant way. Unexcited, I went to my lectures,&nbsp;</p>
<p>worked three nights a week in the record shop reread The Great&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gatsby now and then, and when Sunday came I would do my washing&nbsp;</p>
<p>and write a long letter to Naoko. Sometimes I would go out with&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori for a meal or to the zoo or to the cinema. The sale of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kobayashi Bookshop went as planned, and Midori and her sister&nbsp;</p>
<p>moved into a two-bedroom flat near Myogadani, a more upmarket&nbsp;</p>
<p>neighbourhood. Midori would move out when her sister got married,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and rent a flat by herself, she said. Meanwhile, she invited me to their&nbsp;</p>
<p>282&nbsp;</p>
<p>new place for lunch once. It was a sunny, handsome flat, and Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed to enjoy living there far more than she had above the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kobayashi Bookshop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every once in a while, Nagasawa would suggest that we go out on one&nbsp;</p>
<p>of our excursions, but I always found something else to do instead. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>just didn't want the hassle. Not that I didn't like the idea of sleeping&nbsp;</p>
<p>with girls: it was just that, when I thought about the whole process I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to go through - drinking in town, looking for the right kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>girls, talking to them, going to a hotel - it was all too much effort. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to admire Nagasawa all the more for the way he could continue&nbsp;</p>
<p>the ritual without ever getting sick and tired of it. Maybe what&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi had said to me had had some effect: I could make myself feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>far happier just thinking about Naoko than sleeping with some stupid,&nbsp;</p>
<p>anonymous girl. The sensation of Naoko's fingers bringing me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>climax in a grassy field remained vivid inside me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote to her at the beginning of December to ask if it would be all&nbsp;</p>
<p>right for me to come and visit her during the winter holidays. An&nbsp;</p>
<p>answer came from Reiko saying they would love to have me. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>explained that Naoko was having trouble writing and that she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>answering for her. I was not to take this to mean that Naoko was&nbsp;</p>
<p>feeling especially bad: there was no need for me to worry. These&nbsp;</p>
<p>things came in waves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the holidays came, I stuffed my things into my rucksack, put on&nbsp;</p>
<p>snow boots and set out for Kyoto. The odd doctor had been right: the&nbsp;</p>
<p>winter mountains blanketed in snow were incredibly beautiful. As&nbsp;</p>
<p>before, I slept two nights in the flat with Naoko and Reiko, and spent&nbsp;</p>
<p>three days with them doing much the same kind of things as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the sun went down, Reiko would play her guitar and the three&nbsp;</p>
<p>of us would sit around talking. Instead of our picnic, we went cross</p>
<p>country skiing. An hour of tramping through the woods on skis left us&nbsp;</p>
<p>breathless and sweaty. We also joined the residents and staff&nbsp;</p>
<p>283&nbsp;</p>
<p>shovelling snow when there was time. Doctor Miyata popped over to&nbsp;</p>
<p>our table at dinner to explain why people's middle fingers are longer&nbsp;</p>
<p>than their index fingers, while with toes it worked the other way. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>gatekeeper, Omura, talked to me again about Tokyo pork. Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed the records I brought as gifts from the city. She transcribed a&nbsp;</p>
<p>few tunes and worked them out on her guitar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko was even less talkative than she had been in the autumn. When&nbsp;</p>
<p>the three of us were together, she would sit on the sofa, smiling, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>hardly say a word. Reiko seemed to be chattering away to make up for&nbsp;</p>
<p>her. "But don't worry," Naoko told me. "This is just one of those&nbsp;</p>
<p>times. It's a lot more fun for me to listen to you two than to talk&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko gave herself some chores that took her out of the flat so that&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko and I could get in bed. I kissed her neck and shoulders and&nbsp;</p>
<p>breasts, and she used her hands to bring me to climax as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterwards, holding her close, I told her how her touch had stayed&nbsp;</p>
<p>with me these two months, that I had thought of her and masturbated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You haven't slept with anybody else?" Naoko asked. "Not once," I&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All right, then, here's something else for you to remember." She slid&nbsp;</p>
<p>down and kissed my penis, then enveloped it in her warm mouth and&nbsp;</p>
<p>ran her tongue all over it, her long, straight hair swaying over my&nbsp;</p>
<p>belly and groin with each movement of her lips until I came a second&nbsp;</p>
<p>time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you think you can remember that?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I can," I said. "I'll always remember it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I held her tight and slid my hand inside her panties, touching her still</p>
<p>dry vagina. Naoko shook her head and pulled my hand away. We held&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other for a time, saying nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm thinking of getting out of the dorm when term ends and looking&nbsp;</p>
<p>for a flat," I said. "I've had it with dorm life. If I keep working part</p>
<p>time I can pretty much cover my expenses. How about coming to&nbsp;</p>
<p>284&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo to live with me, the way I suggested before?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, Toru, thank you. I'm so happy that you would ask me to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>something like that!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's not that I think there's anything wrong with this place," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's quiet, the surroundings are perfect, and Reiko is a wonderful&nbsp;</p>
<p>person. But it's not a place to stay for a long time. It's too specialized&nbsp;</p>
<p>for a long stay. The longer you're here, I'm sure, the harder it is to&nbsp;</p>
<p>leave."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Naoko turned her gaze to the outside. Beyond&nbsp;</p>
<p>the window, there was nothing to see but snow. Snow clouds hung&nbsp;</p>
<p>low and heavy in the sky, with only the smallest gap between them&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the snow-covered earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Take your time, think it over," I said. "Whatever happens, I'm going&nbsp;</p>
<p>to move by the end of March. Any time you decide you want to join&nbsp;</p>
<p>me, you can come."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko nodded. I wrapped my arms around her as carefully as if I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been holding a work of art delicately fashioned from glass. She put&nbsp;</p>
<p>her arms around my neck. I was naked, and she wore only the&nbsp;</p>
<p>skimpiest white underwear. Her body was so beautiful, I could have&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed looking at it all day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why don't I get wet?" Naoko murmured. "That one time was the only&nbsp;</p>
<p>time it ever happened. The day of my twentieth birthday, that April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night you held me in your arms. What is wrong with me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's strictly psychological, I'm sure," I said. "Give it time. There's no&nbsp;</p>
<p>hurry."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"All of my problems are strictly psychological," said Naoko. "What if&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never get better? What if I can never have sex for the rest of my life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you keep loving me just the same? Will hands and lips always be&nbsp;</p>
<p>enough for you? Or will you solve the sex problem by sleeping with&nbsp;</p>
<p>other girls?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm a born optimist," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko sat up in bed and slipped on a T-shirt. She put a flannel shirt&nbsp;</p>
<p>285&nbsp;</p>
<p>over this, and then climbed into her jeans. I put my clothes on, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let me think about it," said Naoko. "And you think about it, too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I will," I said. "And speaking of lips, what you did with them just&nbsp;</p>
<p>now was great."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She reddened slightly and gave a little smile. "Kizuki used to say that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He and I had pretty much the same tastes and opinions," I said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>smiling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sat across from each other at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and&nbsp;</p>
<p>talking about the old days. She was beginning to talk more about&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki. She would hesitate, and choose her words carefully. Every&nbsp;</p>
<p>now and then, the snow would fall for a while and stop. The sky never&nbsp;</p>
<p>cleared the whole three days I was there. "I think I can get back here&nbsp;</p>
<p>in March," I said as I was leaving. I gave her one last, heavily padded&nbsp;</p>
<p>hug with my winter coat on, and kissed her on the lips. "Goodbye,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1970 - a year with a whole new sound to it - came along, and that put&nbsp;</p>
<p>an end to my teenage years. Now I could step out into a whole new&nbsp;</p>
<p>swamp. Then it was time for exams, and these I passed with relative&nbsp;</p>
<p>ease. If you have nothing else to do and spend all your time going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>lectures, it takes no special skill to get through end-of-year exams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some problems arose in the dorm, though. A few guys active in one of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the political factions kept their helmets and iron pipes hidden in their&nbsp;</p>
<p>rooms. They had a run-in with some of the baseball-players under the&nbsp;</p>
<p>wing of the dorm Head, as a result of which two of them were injured&nbsp;</p>
<p>and six expelled. The aftershock of the incident was felt for a long&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, spawning minor fights on an almost daily basis. The atmosphere&nbsp;</p>
<p>that hung over the dorm was oppressive, and people's nerves were on&nbsp;</p>
<p>edge. I myself was on the verge of getting knocked out by one of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>baseball-players when Nagasawa intervened and managed to smooth&nbsp;</p>
<p>things over. In any case, it was time for me to get out of there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>286&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once most of my exams were out of the way, I started looking for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>flat in earnest. After a week of searching, I came up with the right&nbsp;</p>
<p>place way out in the suburbs of Kichijoji. The location was not exactly&nbsp;</p>
<p>convenient, but it was a house: an independent house - a real find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally a gardener's shack or some other kind of cottage, it stood&nbsp;</p>
<p>by itself in the corner of a good-sized plot of land, separated from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>main house by a large stretch of neglected garden. The landlord would&nbsp;</p>
<p>use the front gate, and I the back, which would make it possible for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me to preserve my privacy. It had one good-sized room, a little&nbsp;</p>
<p>kitchen and bathroom, and an unimaginably huge closet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It even had a veranda facing the garden. A nice old couple were&nbsp;</p>
<p>renting the house at way below market value on condition that the&nbsp;</p>
<p>tenant was prepared to move out the following year if their grandson&nbsp;</p>
<p>decided to come to Tokyo. They assured me that I could live as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>pleased there; they wouldn't make any demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa helped me with the move. He managed to borrow a van to&nbsp;</p>
<p>transfer my stuff, and, as promised, he gave me his fridge, TV, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>oversize thermos flask. He might not need them any more, but for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>they were perfect. He himself was scheduled to move out in two days,&nbsp;</p>
<p>to a flat in the Mita neighbourhood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I guess we won't be seeing each other for a long time," he said as he&nbsp;</p>
<p>left me, "so keep well. I'm still sure we'll run across each other in&nbsp;</p>
<p>some strange place years from now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm already looking forward to it," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And that time we switched girls, the funny-looking one was way&nbsp;</p>
<p>better."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right on," I said with a laugh. "But anyway, Nagasawa, take care of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatsumi. Good ones like her are hard to find. And she's a lot more&nbsp;</p>
<p>fragile than she looks."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," he said, nodding. "That's why I was hoping you&nbsp;</p>
<p>would take her when I was through. The two of you would make a&nbsp;</p>
<p>287&nbsp;</p>
<p>great couple."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, right!" I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just kidding," said Nagasawa. "Anyway, be happy. I get the feeling a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot of shit is going to come your way, but you're a stubborn bastard,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll handle it. Mind if I give you one piece of advice?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Go ahead."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't feel sorry for yourself," he said. "Only arseholes do that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll keep it in mind," I said. We shook hands and went our separate&nbsp;</p>
<p>ways, he to his new world, and I back to my swamp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three days after my move, I wrote to Naoko. I described my new&nbsp;</p>
<p>house and said how relieved I was to be away from the idiots in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorm and all their stupid brainstorms. Now I could start my new life&nbsp;</p>
<p>with a new frame of mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My window looks out on a big garden, which is used as a meeting&nbsp;</p>
<p>place by all the neighbourhood cats. I like to stretch out on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>veranda and watch them. I'm not sure how many of them get together,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but this is one big gang of cats. They sunbathe in groups. I don't think&nbsp;</p>
<p>they're too pleased to see me living here, but once when I put out an&nbsp;</p>
<p>old chunk of cheese a few of them crept over and nibbled it. They'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably be friends of mine before too long. There's one striped tom&nbsp;</p>
<p>cat in the bunch with half-eaten ears. It's amazing how much he looks&nbsp;</p>
<p>like my old dorm Head. I expect him to start raising the flag any day&nbsp;</p>
<p>now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm kind of far from university here, but once I start my third year I&nbsp;</p>
<p>won't have too many morning lectures, so it shouldn't be too bad. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>may even be better with the time to read on the train. Now all I have&nbsp;</p>
<p>to do is find some easy work out here that I can do three or four days a&nbsp;</p>
<p>week. Then I can get back to my springwinding life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to rush, but April is a good time of year to start new&nbsp;</p>
<p>things, and I can't help feeling that the best thing for us would be to&nbsp;</p>
<p>288&nbsp;</p>
<p>begin living together then. You could go back to university, too, if it&nbsp;</p>
<p>worked out well. If there's a problem with us actually living together, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could find a flat for you in the neighbourhood. The most important&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing is for us to be always near each other. It doesn't have to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>spring, of course. If you think summer is better, that's fine by me, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just let me know what you're thinking, OK?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm planning to put some extra time in at work for a while. To cover&nbsp;</p>
<p>my moving expenses. I'm going to need a fair amount of money for&nbsp;</p>
<p>one thing or another once I start living alone: pots and pans, dishes,&nbsp;</p>
<p>stuff like that. I'll be free in March, though, and I definitely want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>come to see you. What dates work best for you? I'll plan a trip to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kyoto then. I look forward to seeing you and hearing your answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent the next few days buying the things I needed in the nearby&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kichijoji shopping district and started cooking simple meals for&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself at home. I bought some planks at a local timber yard and had&nbsp;</p>
<p>them cut to size so I could make a desk for myself. I thought I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>study on it and, for the time being, eat my meals there, too. I made&nbsp;</p>
<p>some shelves and got in a good selection of spices. A white cat maybe&nbsp;</p>
<p>six months old decided she liked me and started eating at my place. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>called her Seagull.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I had my place sorted out to some extent, I went into town and&nbsp;</p>
<p>found a temporary job as a painter's assistant. I filled two solid weeks&nbsp;</p>
<p>that way. The pay was good, but the work was murder, and the fumes&nbsp;</p>
<p>made my head spin. Every day after work I'd eat at a cheap restaurant,&nbsp;</p>
<p>wash it down with beer, go home and play with the cat, then sleep like&nbsp;</p>
<p>a dead man. No answer came from Naoko during that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in the thick of painting when Midori popped into my mind. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>hadn't been in touch with her for nearly three weeks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realized, and hadn't even told her I had moved. I had mentioned to&nbsp;</p>
<p>her that I was thinking of moving, and she had said, "Oh, really?" and&nbsp;</p>
<p>that was the last time we had talked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>289&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to a phone box and dialled her number. The woman who&nbsp;</p>
<p>answered was probably her sister. When I gave her my name, she said&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just a minute", but Midori never came to the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the sister, or whoever she was, got back on the line. "Midori&nbsp;</p>
<p>says she's too furious to talk to you. You just moved and never said a&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing to her, right? Just disappeared and never told her where you&nbsp;</p>
<p>were going, right? Well, now you've got her boiling mad. And once&nbsp;</p>
<p>she gets mad, she stays that way. Like some kind of animal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look, could you just put her on the phone? I can explain."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She says she doesn't want to hear any explanations."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Can I explain to you, then? I hate to do this to you, but could you just&nbsp;</p>
<p>listen and tell her what I said?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not me! Do it yourself. What kind of man are you? It's your&nbsp;</p>
<p>responsibility, so you do it, and do it right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was hopeless. I thanked her and hung up. I really couldn't blame&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori for being angry. What with all the moving and fixing up and&nbsp;</p>
<p>working for extra cash, I hadn't given her a second thought. Not even&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko had crossed my mind the whole time. This was nothing new&nbsp;</p>
<p>for me. Whenever I get involved in something, I shut out everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then I began to think how I would have felt if the tables had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned and Midori had moved somewhere without telling me where or&nbsp;</p>
<p>getting in touch with me for three weeks. I would have been hurt -&nbsp;</p>
<p>hurt badly, no doubt. No, we weren't lovers, but in a way we had&nbsp;</p>
<p>opened ourselves to each other even more deeply than lovers do. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought caused me a good deal of grief. What a terrible thing it is to&nbsp;</p>
<p>wound someone you really care for - and to do it so unconsciously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as I got home from work, I sat at my new desk and wrote to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori. I told her how I felt as honestly as I could. I apologized,&nbsp;</p>
<p>without explanations or excuses, for having been so careless and&nbsp;</p>
<p>insensitive. I miss you, I wrote. I want to see you&nbsp;</p>
<p>as soon as possible. I want you to see my new house. Please write to&nbsp;</p>
<p>290&nbsp;</p>
<p>me, I said, and sent the letter special delivery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer never came.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was the beginning of one weird spring. I spent the whole holiday&nbsp;</p>
<p>waiting for letters. I couldn't take a trip, I couldn't go home to see my&nbsp;</p>
<p>parents, I couldn't even take a part-time job because there was no&nbsp;</p>
<p>telling when a letter might arrive from Naoko saying she wanted me to&nbsp;</p>
<p>come and see her on such-and-such a date. Afternoons I would spend&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the nearby shopping district in Kichijoji, watching double bills or&nbsp;</p>
<p>reading in a jazz café. I saw no one and talked to almost no one. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>once a week I would write to Naoko. I never suggested to her that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was hoping for an answer. I didn't want to pressure her in any way. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would tell her about my painting job, about Seagull, about the peach&nbsp;</p>
<p>blossom in the garden, about the nice old lady who sold tofu, about&nbsp;</p>
<p>the nasty old lady in the local restaurant, about the meals I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>making for myself. But still, she never wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I was fed up reading or listening to records, I would work a&nbsp;</p>
<p>little in the garden. From my landlord I borrowed a rake and broom&nbsp;</p>
<p>and pruning shears and spent my time pulling weeds and trimming&nbsp;</p>
<p>bushes. It didn't take much to make the garden look good. Once the&nbsp;</p>
<p>owner invited me to join him for a cup of tea, so we sat on the veranda&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the main house drinking green tea and munching on rice crackers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>sharing small talk. After retirement, he had got a job with an insurance&nbsp;</p>
<p>company, he said, but he had left that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too, after a couple of years, and now he was taking it easy. The house&nbsp;</p>
<p>and land had been in the family for a long time, his children were&nbsp;</p>
<p>grown-up and independent, and he could manage a comfortable old&nbsp;</p>
<p>age without working. Which is why he and his wife were always&nbsp;</p>
<p>travelling together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's nice," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No it's not," he answered. "Travelling is no fun. I'd much rather be&nbsp;</p>
<p>working."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He let the garden grow wild, he said, because there were no decent&nbsp;</p>
<p>291&nbsp;</p>
<p>gardeners in the area and because he had developed allergies that&nbsp;</p>
<p>made it impossible for him to do the work himself. Cutting grass made&nbsp;</p>
<p>him sneeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we had finished our tea, he showed me a storage shed and told&nbsp;</p>
<p>me I could use anything I found inside, more or less by way of thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>for my gardening. "We don't have any use for any of this stuff," he&nbsp;</p>
<p>said, "so feel free."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in fact the place was crammed with all kinds of things - an old&nbsp;</p>
<p>wooden bath, a kids' swimming pool, baseball bats. I found an old&nbsp;</p>
<p>bike, a handy-sized dining table with two chairs, a mirror, and a&nbsp;</p>
<p>guitar. "I'd like to borrow these if you don't mind," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Feel free," he said again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent a day working on the bike: cleaning the rust off, oiling the&nbsp;</p>
<p>bearings, pumping up the tyres, adjusting the gears, and taking it to a&nbsp;</p>
<p>bike repair shop to have a new gear cable installed. It looked like a&nbsp;</p>
<p>different bike by the time I had finished. I cleaned a thick layer of dust&nbsp;</p>
<p>off the table and gave it a new coat of varnish. I replaced the strings of&nbsp;</p>
<p>the guitar and glued a section of the body that was coming apart. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>took a wire brush to the rust on the tuning pegs and adjusted those. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>wasn't much of a guitar, but at least I got it to stay in tune. I hadn't had&nbsp;</p>
<p>a guitar in my hands since school, I realized. I sat on the porch and&nbsp;</p>
<p>picked my way through The Drifters' "Up on the Roof" as well as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could. I was amazed to find I still remembered most of the chords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I took a few planks of wood and made myself a square letterbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I painted it red, wrote my name on it, and set it outside my door. Up&nbsp;</p>
<p>until 3 April, the only post that found its way to my box was&nbsp;</p>
<p>something that had been forwarded from the dorm: a notice from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>reunion committee of my school. A class reunion was the last thing I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to have anything to do with. That was the class I had been in&nbsp;</p>
<p>with Kizuki. I threw it in the bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a letter in the box on the afternoon of 4 April. It said Reiko&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ishida on the back. I made a nice, clean cut across the seal with my&nbsp;</p>
<p>292&nbsp;</p>
<p>scissors and went out to the porch to read it. I had a feeling this was&nbsp;</p>
<p>not going to be good news, and I was right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Reiko apologized for making me wait so long for an answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko had been struggling to write me a letter, she said, but she could&nbsp;</p>
<p>never seem to write one through to the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I offered to send you an answer in her place, but every time I pointed&nbsp;</p>
<p>out how wrong it was of her to keep you waiting, she insisted that it&nbsp;</p>
<p>was far too personal a matter, that she would write to you herself,&nbsp;</p>
<p>which is why I haven't written sooner. I'm sorry, really. I hope you can&nbsp;</p>
<p>forgive me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you must have had a difficult month waiting for an answer, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>believe me, the month has been just as difficult for Naoko. Please try&nbsp;</p>
<p>to understand what she's been going through. Her condition is not&nbsp;</p>
<p>good, I have to say in all honesty. She was trying her best to stand on&nbsp;</p>
<p>her own two feet, but so far the results have not been good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back, I see now that the first symptom of her problem was&nbsp;</p>
<p>her loss of the ability to write letters. That happened around the end of&nbsp;</p>
<p>November or beginning of December. Then she started hearing things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever she would try to write a letter, she would hear people&nbsp;</p>
<p>talking to her, which made it impossible for her to write. The voices&nbsp;</p>
<p>would interfere with her attempts to choose her words. It wasn't all&nbsp;</p>
<p>that bad until about the time of your second visit, so I didn't take it too&nbsp;</p>
<p>seriously. For all of us here, these kinds of symptoms come in cycles,&nbsp;</p>
<p>more or less. In her case, they got quite serious after you left. She is&nbsp;</p>
<p>having trouble now just holding an ordinary conversation. She can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>find the right words to speak, and that puts her into a terribly confused&nbsp;</p>
<p>state - confused and frightened. Meanwhile, the "things" she's hearing&nbsp;</p>
<p>are getting worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a session every day with one of the specialists. Naoko and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the doctor and I sit around talking and trying to find the exact part of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her that's broken. I came up with the idea that it would be good to add&nbsp;</p>
<p>293&nbsp;</p>
<p>you to one of our sessions if possible, and the doctor was in favour of&nbsp;</p>
<p>it, but Naoko was against it. I can tell you exactly what her reason&nbsp;</p>
<p>was: "I want my body to be clean of all this when I meet him." That&nbsp;</p>
<p>was not the problem, I said to her; the problem was to get her well as&nbsp;</p>
<p>quickly as possible, and I pushed as hard as I could, but she wouldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>change her mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I once explained to you that this is not a specialized hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do have medical specialists here, of course, and they provide&nbsp;</p>
<p>effective treatments, but concentrated therapy is another matter. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>point of this place is to create an effective environment in which the&nbsp;</p>
<p>patient can treat herself or himself, and that does not, properly&nbsp;</p>
<p>speaking, include medical treatment. Which means that if Naoko's&nbsp;</p>
<p>condition grows any worse, they will probably have to transfer her to&nbsp;</p>
<p>some other hospital or medical facility or what have you. Personally, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would find this very painful, but we would have to do it. That isn't to&nbsp;</p>
<p>say that she couldn't come back here for treatment on a kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>temporary "leave of absence". Or, better yet, she could even be cured&nbsp;</p>
<p>and finish with hospitals completely. In any case, we're doing&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything we can, and Naoko is doing everything she can. The best&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing you can do meanwhile is hope for her recovery and keep sending&nbsp;</p>
<p>her those letters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was dated 31 March. After I had read it, I stayed on the porch and&nbsp;</p>
<p>let my eyes wander out to the garden, full now with the freshness of&nbsp;</p>
<p>spring. An old cherry tree stood there, its blossoms nearing the height&nbsp;</p>
<p>of their glory. A soft breeze blew, and the light of day lent its&nbsp;</p>
<p>strangely blurred, smoky colours to everything. Seagull wandered&nbsp;</p>
<p>over from somewhere, and after scratching at the boards of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>veranda for a while, she stretched out next to me and fell asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew I should be doing some serious thinking, but I had no idea how&nbsp;</p>
<p>to go about it. And, to tell the truth, thinking was the last thing I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to do. The time would come soon enough when I had no&nbsp;</p>
<p>294&nbsp;</p>
<p>choice in the matter, and when that time came I would take a good,&nbsp;</p>
<p>long while to think things over. Not now, though. Not now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent the day staring at the garden, propped against a pillar and&nbsp;</p>
<p>stroking Seagull. I felt completely drained. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>afternoon deepened, twilight approached, and bluish shadows&nbsp;</p>
<p>enveloped the garden. Seagull disappeared, but I went on staring at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>cherry blossoms. In the spring gloom, they looked like flesh that had&nbsp;</p>
<p>burst through the skin over festering wounds. The garden filled up&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the sweet, heavy stench of rotting flesh. And that's when I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought of Naoko's flesh. Naoko's beautiful flesh lay before me in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness, countless buds bursting through her skin, green and&nbsp;</p>
<p>trembling in an almost imperceptible breeze. Why did such a beautiful&nbsp;</p>
<p>body have to be so ill? I wondered. Why didn't they just leave Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>alone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went inside and drew my curtains, but even indoors there was no&nbsp;</p>
<p>escape from the smell of spring. It filled everything from the ground&nbsp;</p>
<p>up. But the only thing the smell of spring brought to mind for me now&nbsp;</p>
<p>was that putrefying stench. Shut in behind my curtains, I felt a violent&nbsp;</p>
<p>loathing for spring. I hated what the spring had in store for me; I hated&nbsp;</p>
<p>the dull, throbbing ache it aroused inside me. I had never hated&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything in my life with such intensity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent three full days after that all but walking on the bottom of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sea. I could hardly hear what people said to me, and they had just as&nbsp;</p>
<p>much trouble catching anything I had to say. My whole body felt&nbsp;</p>
<p>enveloped in some kind of membrane, cutting off any direct contact&nbsp;</p>
<p>between me and the outside world. I couldn't touch "them", and "they"&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't touch me. I was utterly helpless, and as long as I remained in&nbsp;</p>
<p>that state, "they" were unable to reach out to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat leaning against the wall, staring up at the ceiling. When I felt&nbsp;</p>
<p>hungry I would nibble anything within reach, drink some water, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>when the sadness of it got to me, I'd knock myself out with whisky. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't bathe, I didn't shave. This is how the three days went by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>295&nbsp;</p>
<p>A letter came from Midori on 6 April. She invited me to meet her on&nbsp;</p>
<p>campus and have lunch on the tenth when we had to enroll for&nbsp;</p>
<p>lectures. I put off writing to you as long as I could, which makes us&nbsp;</p>
<p>even, so let's make up. I have to admit it, I miss you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the letter again and again, four times all together, and still I&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't tell what she was trying to say to me. What could it possibly&nbsp;</p>
<p>mean? My brain was so fogged over, I couldn't find the connection&nbsp;</p>
<p>from one sentence to the next. How would meeting her on enrolment&nbsp;</p>
<p>day make us "even"? Why did she want to have "lunch" with me? I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was really losing it. My mind had gone slack, like the soggy roots of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>subterranean plant. But somehow I knew I had to snap out of it. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>then those words of Nagasawa's came to mind: "Don't feel sorry for&nbsp;</p>
<p>yourself. Only arseholes do that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, Nagasawa. Right on," I heard myself thinking. I let out a sigh&nbsp;</p>
<p>and got to my feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did my laundry for the first time in weeks, went to the public bath&nbsp;</p>
<p>and shaved, cleaned my place up, shopped for food and cooked myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>a decent meal for a change, fed the starving Seagull, drank only beer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and did 30 minutes of exercise. Shaving, I discovered in the mirror&nbsp;</p>
<p>that I was becoming emaciated. My eyes were popping. I could hardly&nbsp;</p>
<p>recognize myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went out the next morning on a longish bike ride, and after finishing&nbsp;</p>
<p>lunch at home, I read Reiko's letter one more time. Then thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>seriously about what I ought to do next. The main reason I had taken&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko's letter so hard was that it had upset my optimistic belief that&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko was getting better. Naoko herself had told me, "My sickness is&nbsp;</p>
<p>a lot worse than you think: it has far deeper roots." And Reiko had&nbsp;</p>
<p>warned me there was no telling what might happen. Still, I had seen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko twice, and had gained the impression she was on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>mend. I had assumed that the only problem was whether she could&nbsp;</p>
<p>296&nbsp;</p>
<p>regain the courage to return to the real world, and that if she managed&nbsp;</p>
<p>to, the two of us could join forces and make&nbsp;</p>
<p>a go of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko's letter smashed the illusory castle that I had built on that fragile&nbsp;</p>
<p>hypothesis, leaving only a flattened surface devoid of feeling. I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to do something to regain my footing. It would probably take a&nbsp;</p>
<p>long time for Naoko to recover. And even then, she would no doubt be&nbsp;</p>
<p>more debilitated and would have lost even more of her self confidence&nbsp;</p>
<p>than ever. I would have to adapt myself to this new situation. As&nbsp;</p>
<p>strong as I might become, though, it would not solve all the problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew that much. But there was nothing else I could do: just keep my&nbsp;</p>
<p>own spirits up and wait for her to recover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, there, Kizuki, I thought. Unlike you, I've chosen to live - and to&nbsp;</p>
<p>live the best I know how. Sure, it was hard for you. What the hell, it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>hard for me. Really hard. And all because you killed yourself and left&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko behind. But that's something I will never do. I will never, ever,&nbsp;</p>
<p>turn my back on her. First of all, because I love her, and because I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>stronger than she is. And I'm just going to keep on getting stronger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to mature. I'm going to be an adult. Because that's what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>have to do. I always used to think I'd like to stay 17 or 18 if I could.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not any more. I'm not a teenager any more. I've got a sense of&nbsp;</p>
<p>responsibility now. I'm not the same person I was when we used to&nbsp;</p>
<p>hang out together. I'm 20 now. And I have to pay the price to go on&nbsp;</p>
<p>living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Shit, Watanabe, what happened to you?" Midori asked. "You're all&nbsp;</p>
<p>skin and bones!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That bad, huh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Too much you-know-what with that married girlfriend of yours, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>bet."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I smiled and shook my head. "I haven't slept with a girl since the&nbsp;</p>
<p>297&nbsp;</p>
<p>beginning of October."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Whew! That can't be true. We're talking six months here!" "You&nbsp;</p>
<p>heard me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So how did you lose so much weight?" "By growing up," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori put her hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eye with a&nbsp;</p>
<p>twisted scowl that soon turned into a sweet smile. "It's true," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Something's kind of different. You've changed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I told you, I grew up. I'm an adult now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're fantastic, the way your brain works," she said as though&nbsp;</p>
<p>genuinely impressed. "Let's eat. I'm starving."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went to a little restaurant behind the literature department. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>ordered the lunch special and she did the same. "Hey, Watanabe, are&nbsp;</p>
<p>you mad at me?" "What for?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For not answering you, just to get even. Do you think I shouldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>have done that? I mean, you apologized and everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, but it was my fault to begin with. That's just how it goes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My sister says I shouldn't have done it. That it was too unforgiving,&nbsp;</p>
<p>too childish."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, but it made you feel better, didn't it, getting even like that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"OK, then, that's that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You are forgiving, aren't you?" Midori said. "But tell me the truth,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watanabe, you haven't had sex for six months?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not once."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So, that time you put me to bed, you must have really wanted it bad."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess I did."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you didn't do it, did you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look, you're the best friend I've got now," I said. "I don't want to lose&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, if you had tried to force yourself on me that time, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wouldn't have been able to resist, I was so exhausted."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I was too big and hard," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>298&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori smiled and touched my wrist. "A little before that, I decided I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was going to believe in you. A hundred per cent. That's how I&nbsp;</p>
<p>managed to sleep like that with total peace of mind. I knew I'd be all&nbsp;</p>
<p>right, I'd be safe with you there. And I did sleep like a log, didn't I?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You sure did."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"On the other hand, if you were to say to me, "Hey, Midori, let's do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then everything'll be great,' I'd probably do it with you. Now, don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>think I'm trying to seduce you or tease you. I'm just telling you what's&nbsp;</p>
<p>on my mind, with total honesty."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know, I know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we ate lunch, we showed each other our enrolment cards and&nbsp;</p>
<p>found that we had enrolled for two of the same courses. So I'd be&nbsp;</p>
<p>seeing her twice a week at least. With that out of the way, Midori told&nbsp;</p>
<p>me about her living arrangements. For a while, neither she nor her&nbsp;</p>
<p>sister could get used to living in a flat - because it was too easy, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. They had always been used to running around like mad every&nbsp;</p>
<p>day, taking care of sick people, helping out at the bookshop, and one&nbsp;</p>
<p>thing or another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're finally getting used to it, though," she said. "This is the way we&nbsp;</p>
<p>should have been living all along - not having to worry about anyone&nbsp;</p>
<p>else's needs, just stretching out any way we felt like it. It made us both&nbsp;</p>
<p>nervous at first, as if our bodies were floating a few inches off the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ground. It didn't seem real, like real life couldn't actually be like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were both tense, as though everything was about to be tipped&nbsp;</p>
<p>upside down any minute."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A couple of worriers," I said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, it's just that life has been so cruel to us until now,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori said. "But that's OK. We're going to get back every thing it&nbsp;</p>
<p>owes us."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I bet you are," I said, "knowing you. But tell me, what's your sister&nbsp;</p>
<p>doing these days?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A friend of hers opened this swanky accessory shop a little while&nbsp;</p>
<p>299&nbsp;</p>
<p>ago. My sister helps out there three times a week. Otherwise, she's&nbsp;</p>
<p>studying cookery, going on dates with her fiancé, going to the cinema,&nbsp;</p>
<p>vegging out, and just enjoying life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori then asked about my new life. I gave her a description of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>layout of the house, and the big garden and Seagull the cat, and my&nbsp;</p>
<p>landlord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you enjoying yourself?" she asked. "Pretty much," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Could have fooled me," said Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, and it's springtime, too," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you're wearing that cool pullover your girlfriend knitted for&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a sudden shock I glanced down at my wine-coloured jumper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How did you know?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're as honest as they come," said Midori. "I'm guessing, of&nbsp;</p>
<p>course! Anyway, what's wrong with you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm trying to whip up a little enthusiasm." "Just&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember, life is a box of chocolates."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head a few times and looked at her. "Maybe I'm not so&nbsp;</p>
<p>smart, but sometimes I don't know what on earth you're talking&nbsp;</p>
<p>about."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, they've got these chocolate assortments, and you like&nbsp;</p>
<p>some but you don't like others? And you eat all the ones you like, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only ones left are the ones you don't like as much? I always think&nbsp;</p>
<p>about that when something painful comes up. "Now I just have to&nbsp;</p>
<p>polish these off, and everything'll be OK.' Life is a box of chocolates."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I suppose you could call it a philosophy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true, though. I've learned it from experience."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were drinking our coffee when two girls came in. Midori seemed&nbsp;</p>
<p>to know them from university. The three of them compared enrolment&nbsp;</p>
<p>cards and talked about a million different things: "What kind of mark&nbsp;</p>
<p>300&nbsp;</p>
<p>did you get in German?" "So-and-so got hurt in the campus riots."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great shoes, where did you buy them?" I half-listened, but it felt as&nbsp;</p>
<p>though their comments were coming from the other side of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sipped my coffee and watched the scene passing by the shop&nbsp;</p>
<p>window. It was a typical university springtime scene as the new year&nbsp;</p>
<p>was getting under way: a haze hanging in the sky, the cherry trees&nbsp;</p>
<p>blooming, the new students (you could tell at a glance) carrying&nbsp;</p>
<p>armloads of new books. I felt myself drifting off a little and thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about Naoko, unable to return to her studies again this year. A small&nbsp;</p>
<p>glass full of anemones stood by the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the other two went back to their table, Midori and I left to walk&nbsp;</p>
<p>around the neighbourhood. We visited a few second-hand bookshops,&nbsp;</p>
<p>bought some books, went to another café for another cup, played some&nbsp;</p>
<p>pinball at an arcade, and sat on a park bench, talking - or, rather,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori talked while I merely grunted in response. When she said she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was thirsty, I ran over to a newsagent's and bought us two Cokes. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>came back to find her scribbling away with her ballpoint pen on some&nbsp;</p>
<p>ruled paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's that?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have to go," she announced at 3.30. "I'm supposed to meet my sister&nbsp;</p>
<p>at the Ginza."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We walked to the subway station and went off in different directions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As she left, Midori stuffed the piece of paper, now folded in four, into&nbsp;</p>
<p>my pocket. "Read this when you get home," she said. I read it on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>train.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter to you while you're off buying drinks. This is the&nbsp;</p>
<p>first time in my life I've ever written a letter to somebody sitting next&nbsp;</p>
<p>to me on a bench, but I feel it's the only way I can get through to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, you're hardly listening to anything I say. Am I right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you realize you did something terrible to me today? You never&nbsp;</p>
<p>301&nbsp;</p>
<p>even noticed that my hairstyle had changed, did you? I've been&nbsp;</p>
<p>working on it forever, trying to grow it out, and finally, at the end of&nbsp;</p>
<p>last week, I managed to get it into a style you could actually call&nbsp;</p>
<p>girlish, but you never even noticed. It was looking pretty good, so I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought I'd give you a little shock when you saw me for the first time&nbsp;</p>
<p>after so long, but it didn't even register with you. Don't you think that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>awful? I bet you can't even remember what I was wearing today. Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a girl! So what if you've got something on your mind? You can&nbsp;</p>
<p>spare me one decent look! All you had to say was "Cute hair", and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>would have been able to forgive you for being sunk in a million&nbsp;</p>
<p>thoughts, but no!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why I'm going to tell you a lie. It's not true that I have to&nbsp;</p>
<p>meet my sister at the Ginza. I was planning to spend the night at your&nbsp;</p>
<p>place. I even brought my pyjamas with me. It's true. I've got my&nbsp;</p>
<p>pyjamas and a toothbrush in my bag. I'm such an idiot! I mean, you&nbsp;</p>
<p>never even invited me over to see your new place. Oh well, what the&nbsp;</p>
<p>hell, you obviously want to be alone, so I'll leave you alone. Go ahead&nbsp;</p>
<p>and think away to your heart's content!&nbsp;</p>
<p>But don't get me wrong. I'm not totally mad at you. I'm just sad. You&nbsp;</p>
<p>were so nice to me when I was having my problems, but now that&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're having yours, it seems there's not a thing I can do for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're all locked up in that little world of yours, and when I try&nbsp;</p>
<p>knocking on the door, you just sort of look up for a second and go&nbsp;</p>
<p>right back inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I see you coming back with our drinks - walking and thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping you'd trip, but you didn't. Now you're sitting next to me&nbsp;</p>
<p>drinking your Coke. I was holding out one last hope that you'd notice&nbsp;</p>
<p>and say "Hey, your hair's changed!" but no. If you had, I would have&nbsp;</p>
<p>torn up this letter and said: "Let's go to your place. I'll make you a nice&nbsp;</p>
<p>dinner. And afterwards we can go to bed and cuddle." But you're&nbsp;</p>
<p>about as sensitive as a steel plate. Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. Please don't talk to me next time we meet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>302&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rang Midori's flat from the station when I got off the train in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kichijoji, but there was no answer. With nothing better to do, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>ambled around the neighbourhood looking for some part-time work I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could take after lectures began. I would be free all day Saturday and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunday and could work after five o'clock on Mondays, Wednesdays&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Thursdays; but finding a job that fitted my particular schedule was&nbsp;</p>
<p>no easy matter. I gave up and went home. When I went out to buy&nbsp;</p>
<p>groceries for dinner, I tried Midori's place again. Her sister told me&nbsp;</p>
<p>that Midori hadn't come home yet and that she had no idea when she'd&nbsp;</p>
<p>be back. I thanked her and hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After eating, I tried to write to Midori, but I gave up after several false&nbsp;</p>
<p>starts and wrote to Naoko instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spring was here, I said, and the new university year was starting. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>told her I missed her, that I had been hoping, one way or another, to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>able to meet her and talk. In any case,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote, I've decided to make myself strong. As far as I can tell, that's&nbsp;</p>
<p>all I can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's one other thing. Maybe it's just to do with me, and you may&nbsp;</p>
<p>not care about this one way or another, but I'm not sleeping with&nbsp;</p>
<p>anybody any more. It's because I don't want to forget the last time you&nbsp;</p>
<p>touched me. It meant a lot more to me than you might think. I think&nbsp;</p>
<p>about it all of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put the letter in an envelope, stuck on a stamp, and sat at my desk a&nbsp;</p>
<p>long while staring at it. It was a much shorter letter than usual, but I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had the feeling that Naoko might understand me better that way. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>poured myself an inch-and-a-half of whisky, drank it in two swallows,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and went to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day I found a job near Kichijoji Station that I could do on&nbsp;</p>
<p>303&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturdays and Sundays: waiting on tables at a smallish Italian&nbsp;</p>
<p>restaurant. The conditions were pretty poor, but travel&nbsp;</p>
<p>and lunch expenses were included. And whenever somebody on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>late shift took the day off on a Monday, Wednesday or Thursday&nbsp;</p>
<p>(which happened often) I could take their place. This was perfect for&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. The manager said they would raise my pay when I had stayed for&nbsp;</p>
<p>three months, and they wanted me to start that Saturday. He was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>much more decent guy than the idiot who ran the record shop in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shinjuku.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried phoning Midori's flat again, and again her sister answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori hadn't come back since yesterday, she said, sounding tired, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>now she herself was beginning to worry: did I have any idea where&nbsp;</p>
<p>she might have gone? All I knew was that Midori had her pyjamas and&nbsp;</p>
<p>a toothbrush in her bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw Midori at the lecture on Wednesday. She was wearing a deep&nbsp;</p>
<p>green pullover and the dark sunglasses she had often worn that&nbsp;</p>
<p>summer. She was seated in the last row, talking with a thin girl with&nbsp;</p>
<p>glasses I had seen once before. I approached her and said I'd like to&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk afterwards. The girl with glasses looked at me first, and then&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori looked at me. Her hairstyle was, in fact, somewhat more&nbsp;</p>
<p>feminine than it had been before: more mature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have to meet someone," she said, cocking her head slightly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I won't take up much of your time," I said. "Five minutes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori removed her sunglasses and narrowed her eyes. She might just&nbsp;</p>
<p>as well have been looking at a crumbling, abandoned house some&nbsp;</p>
<p>hundred yards in the distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk to you. Sorry," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girl with glasses looked at me with eyes that said: She says she&nbsp;</p>
<p>doesn't want to talk to you. Sorry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat at the right end of the front row for the lecture (an overview of&nbsp;</p>
<p>304&nbsp;</p>
<p>the works of Tennessee Williams and their place in American&nbsp;</p>
<p>literature), and when it was over, I did a long count to three and turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>around. Midori was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April was too lonely a month to spend all alone. In April, everyone&nbsp;</p>
<p>around me looked happy. People would throw off their coats and&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoy each other's company in the sunshine - talking, playing catch,&nbsp;</p>
<p>holding hands. But I was always by myself. Naoko, Midori,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nagasawa: all of them had gone away from where I stood. Now I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>no one to say "Good morning" to or "Have a nice day". I even missed&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storm Trooper. I spent the whole month with this hopeless sense of&nbsp;</p>
<p>isolation. I tried to speak to Midori a few times, but the answer I got&nbsp;</p>
<p>from her was always the same: "I don't want to talk to you now" - and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew from the tone of her voice that she meant it. She was always&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the girl with glasses, or else I saw her with a tall, short-haired&nbsp;</p>
<p>guy. He had these incredibly long legs and always wore white&nbsp;</p>
<p>basketball shoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April ended and May came along, but May was even worse than&nbsp;</p>
<p>April. In the deepening spring of May, I had no choice but to&nbsp;</p>
<p>recognize the trembling of my heart. It usually happened as the sun&nbsp;</p>
<p>was going down. In the pale evening gloom, when the soft fragrance&nbsp;</p>
<p>of magnolias hung in the air, my heart would swell without warning,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and tremble, and lurch with a stab of pain. I would try clamping my&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes shut and gritting my teeth, and wait for it to pass. And it would&nbsp;</p>
<p>pass - but slowly, taking its own time, and leaving a dull ache in its&nbsp;</p>
<p>path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At those times I would write to Naoko. In my letters to her, I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>describe only things that were touching or pleasant or beautiful: the&nbsp;</p>
<p>fragrance of grasses, the caress of a spring breeze, the light of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>moon, a film I'd seen, a song I liked, a book that had moved me. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself would be comforted by&nbsp;</p>
<p>letters like this when I would reread what I had written. And I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel that the world I lived in was a wonderful one. I wrote any number&nbsp;</p>
<p>305&nbsp;</p>
<p>of letters like this, but from Naoko or Reiko I heard nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the restaurant where I worked I got to know another student my&nbsp;</p>
<p>age named Itoh. It took quite a while before this gentle, quiet student&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the oil-painting department of an art college would engage me in&nbsp;</p>
<p>conversation, but eventually we started going to a nearby bar after&nbsp;</p>
<p>work and talking about all kinds of things. He also liked to read and to&nbsp;</p>
<p>listen to music, so we'd usually talk about books and records we liked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was a slim, good-looking guy with much shorter hair and far&nbsp;</p>
<p>cleaner clothes than the typical art student. He never had a lot to say,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but he had his definite tastes and opinions. He liked French novels,&nbsp;</p>
<p>especially those of Georges Bataille and Boris Vian. For music, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>preferred Mozart and Ravel. And, like me, he was looking for a friend&nbsp;</p>
<p>with whom he could talk about such things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itoh once invited me to his flat. It was not quite as hard to get to as&nbsp;</p>
<p>mine: a strange, one-floored house behind Inokashira Park. His room&nbsp;</p>
<p>was stuffed with painting supplies and canvases. I asked to see his&nbsp;</p>
<p>work, but he said he was too embarrassed to show me anything. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>drank some Chivas Regal that he had quietly removed from his&nbsp;</p>
<p>father's place, grilled some smelts on his charcoal stove, and listened&nbsp;</p>
<p>to Robert Casadesus playing a Mozart piano concerto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itoh was from Nagasaki. He had a girlfriend he would sleep with&nbsp;</p>
<p>whenever he went home, he said, but things weren't going too well&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her lately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know what girls are like," he said. "They turn 20 or 21 and all of&nbsp;</p>
<p>a sudden they start having these concrete ideas. They get super</p>
<p>realistic. And when that happens, everything that seemed so sweet and&nbsp;</p>
<p>loveable about them begins to look ordinary and depressing. Now&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I see her, usually after we do it, she starts asking me, "What are&nbsp;</p>
<p>you going to do after you graduate?"'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, what are you going to do after you graduate?" I asked him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munching on a mouthful of smelt, he shook his head. "What can I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in oil painting! Start worrying about stuff like that, and nobody's&nbsp;</p>
<p>306&nbsp;</p>
<p>going to study oil painting! You don't do it to feed yourself. So she's&nbsp;</p>
<p>like, "Why don't you come back to Nagasaki and become an art&nbsp;</p>
<p>teacher?' She's planning to be an English teacher."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're not so crazy about her any more, are you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That just about sums it up," Itoh admitted. "And who on earth wants&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be an art teacher? I'm not gonna spend my whole fuckin' life&nbsp;</p>
<p>teaching teenaged monkeys how to draw!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's beside the point," I said. "Don't you think you ought to break&nbsp;</p>
<p>up with her? For both your sakes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure I do. But I don't know how to say it to her. She's planning to&nbsp;</p>
<p>spend her life with me. How the hell can I say, "Hey, we ought to split&nbsp;</p>
<p>up. I don't like you any more'?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>We drank our Chivas straight, without ice, and when we ran out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>smelts we cut up some cucumbers and celery and dipped them in&nbsp;</p>
<p>miso. When my teeth crunched down on my cucumber slices, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought of Midori's father, which reminded me how flat and tasteless&nbsp;</p>
<p>my life had become without Midori and this put me in a foul mood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without my being aware of it, she had become a huge presence inside&nbsp;</p>
<p>me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Got a girlfriend?" asked Itoh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said, then, after a pause added, "but I can't be with her at the&nbsp;</p>
<p>moment."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But you understand each other's feelings, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like to think so. Otherwise, what's the point?" I said with a chuckle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itoh talked in hushed tones about the greatness of Mozart. He knew&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mozart inside out, the way a country boy knows his mountain trails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His father loved the music and had exposed him to it ever since he&nbsp;</p>
<p>was tiny. I didn't know so much about classical music, but listening to&nbsp;</p>
<p>this Mozart concerto with Itoh's smart and heartfelt commentary&nbsp;</p>
<p>("There - that part," "How about that?"), I felt myself calming down&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the first time in ages. We stared at the crescent moon hanging over&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inokashira Park and drank our Chivas Regal to the last drop. Fantastic&nbsp;</p>
<p>307&nbsp;</p>
<p>whisky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itoh said I could spend the night there, but I told him I had to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>something, thanked him for the whisky and left his flat before nine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the way back to my place I called Midori from a phone box. Much&nbsp;</p>
<p>to my surprise she actually answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said, "but I don't want to talk to you right now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know, I know. But I don't want our relationship to end like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're one of the very few friends I have, and it hurts not being able&nbsp;</p>
<p>to see you. When am I going to be able to talk to you? I want you to&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell me that much, at least."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I feel like talking to you," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How are you?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine," she said, and hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A letter came from Reiko in the middle of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing so often. Naoko enjoys your letters. And so do I.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't mind if I read them, do you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I haven't been able to answer for such a long time. To tell you&nbsp;</p>
<p>the truth, I've been feeling a bit exhausted, and there hasn't been much&nbsp;</p>
<p>good news to report. Naoko's not doing well. Her mother came from&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kobe the other day. The four of us - she and Naoko and the doctor and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I - had a good, long talk and we reached the conclusion that Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>should move to a real hospital for a while for some intensive treatment&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then maybe come back here depending on the results. Naoko says&nbsp;</p>
<p>she'd like to stay here if possible and make herself well, and I know I&nbsp;</p>
<p>am going to miss her and worry about her, but the fact is that it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>getting harder and harder to keep her under control here. She's fine&nbsp;</p>
<p>most of the time, but sometimes her emotions become extremely&nbsp;</p>
<p>unstable, and when that happens we can't take our eyes off her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no telling what she would do. When she has those intense&nbsp;</p>
<p>episodes of hearing voices, she shuts down completely and burrows&nbsp;</p>
<p>308&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why I myself agree that the best thing for Naoko would be&nbsp;</p>
<p>for her to receive therapy at a proper institution for a while. I hate to&nbsp;</p>
<p>say it, but it's all we can do. As I told you once before, patience is the&nbsp;</p>
<p>most important thing. We have to go on unravelling the jumbled&nbsp;</p>
<p>threads one at a time, without losing hope. No matter how hopeless&nbsp;</p>
<p>her condition may appear to be, we are bound to find that one loose&nbsp;</p>
<p>thread sooner or later. If you're in pitch blackness, all you can do is sit&nbsp;</p>
<p>tight until your eyes get used to the dark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko should have moved to that other hospital by the time you&nbsp;</p>
<p>receive this. I'm sorry I waited to tell you until the decisions had been&nbsp;</p>
<p>made, but it happened very quickly. The new hospital is a really good&nbsp;</p>
<p>one,&nbsp;</p>
<p>with good doctors. I'll write the address below: please write to Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>there. They will be keeping me informed of her progress, too, so I will&nbsp;</p>
<p>let you know what I hear. I hope it will be good news. I know this is&nbsp;</p>
<p>going to be hard for you, but keep your hopes up. And even though&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko is not here any more, please write to me once in a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote a huge number of letters that spring: one a week to Naoko,&nbsp;</p>
<p>several to Reiko, and several more to Midori. I wrote letters in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>lecture hall, I wrote letters at my desk at home with Seagull on my lap,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote letters at empty tables during my breaks at the Italian&nbsp;</p>
<p>restaurant. It was as if I were writing letters to hold together the pieces&nbsp;</p>
<p>of my crumbling life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Midori I wrote: April and May were painful, lonely months for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>because I couldn't talk to you. I never knew that spring could be so&nbsp;</p>
<p>painful and lonely. Better to have three Februaries than a spring like&nbsp;</p>
<p>this. I know it's too late to be saying this, but your new hairstyle looks&nbsp;</p>
<p>great on you. Really cute. I'm working at an Italian restaurant now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the cook taught me a great way to make spaghetti. I'd like to make&nbsp;</p>
<p>309&nbsp;</p>
<p>it for you soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the university every day, worked in the restaurant two or&nbsp;</p>
<p>three times a week, talked with Itoh about books and music, read a&nbsp;</p>
<p>few Boris Vian novels he lent me, wrote letters, played with Seagull,&nbsp;</p>
<p>made spaghetti, worked in the garden, masturbated thinking of Naoko,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and saw lots of films.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was almost the middle of June by the time Midori started talking to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. We hadn't said a word to each other for two months. After the end&nbsp;</p>
<p>of one lecture, she sat down next to me, propped her chin in her hand,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and sat there, saying nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the window, it was raining - a really rainy-season rain,&nbsp;</p>
<p>pouring straight down without any wind, soaking every single thing&nbsp;</p>
<p>beneath. Long after the other students had filed out of the classroom,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori went on sitting next to me without a word. Then she took a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marlboro from the pocket of her jeans jacket, put it between her lips,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and handed me her matches. I struck a match and lit her cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori pursed her lips and blew a gentle cloud of tobacco in my face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Like my hairstyle?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's great."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How great?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great enough to knock down all the trees in all the forests of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>world."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You really think so?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I really think so."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She kept her eyes on mine for a while, then held her right hand out to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. I took it. She looked even more relieved than I felt. She tapped&nbsp;</p>
<p>her ashes onto the floor and rose to her feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let's eat. I'm starving," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where do you want to go?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To the restaurant of the Takashimaya department store in&nbsp;</p>
<p>310&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nihonbashi."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why there of all places?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like to go there sometimes, that's all."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so we took the subway to Nihonbashi. The place was practically&nbsp;</p>
<p>empty, maybe because it had been raining all morning. The smell of&nbsp;</p>
<p>rain filled the big, cavernous department store, and all the employees&nbsp;</p>
<p>had that what-do-we-do-now? kind of look. Midori and I went to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>basement restaurant and, after a close inspection of the plastic food in&nbsp;</p>
<p>the window, both decided to have an old-fashioned cold lunch&nbsp;</p>
<p>assortment with rice and pickles and grilled fish and&nbsp;</p>
<p>tempura and teriyaki chicken. Inside, it was far from crowded despite&nbsp;</p>
<p>it being midday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"God, how long has it been since I last had lunch in a department</p>
<p>store restaurant?" I wondered aloud, drinking green tea from one of&nbsp;</p>
<p>those slick, white cups you only get in a department-store restaurant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like to do stuff like this," said Midori. "I don't know, it makes me&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel like I'm doing something special. Probably reminds me of when I&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a kid. My parents almost never took me to department stores."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And I get the sneaking suspicion that's all mine ever did. My mother&nbsp;</p>
<p>was crazy about them."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lucky you!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? I don't particularly like going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>department stores."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, I mean, you were lucky they cared enough about you to take you&nbsp;</p>
<p>places.'-"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, I was an only child," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I was little I used to dream about going to a department-store&nbsp;</p>
<p>restaurant all by myself when I grew up and eating anything I liked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what an empty dream! What's the fun of cramming your mouth&nbsp;</p>
<p>full of rice all alone in a place like this? The food's not all that great,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it's just big and crowded and stuffy and noisy. Still, every once in&nbsp;</p>
<p>a while I think about coming here."&nbsp;</p>
<p>311&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've been really lonely these past two months," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know. You told me in your letters," Midori said, her voice&nbsp;</p>
<p>flat. "Anyway, let's eat. That's all I can think about now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We finished all the little fried and grilled and pickled items in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>separate compartments of our fancy lacquered half-moon lunch boxes,&nbsp;</p>
<p>drank our clear soup from lacquered bowls, and our green tea from&nbsp;</p>
<p>those white cups. Midori followed lunch with a cigarette. When she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had finished smoking, she stood up without a word and took her&nbsp;</p>
<p>umbrella. I also stood up and took mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Where do you want to go now?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The roof, of course. That's the next stop when you've had lunch in a&nbsp;</p>
<p>department-store restaurant."&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no one on the roof in the rain, no clerk in the pet&nbsp;</p>
<p>department, and the shutters were closed in the kiosks and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>children's rides ticket booth. We opened our umbrellas and wandered&nbsp;</p>
<p>among the soaking wet wooden horses and garden chairs and stalls. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>seemed incredible to me that there could be anywhere so devoid of&nbsp;</p>
<p>people in the middle of Tokyo. Midori said she wanted to look&nbsp;</p>
<p>through a telescope, so I put in a coin and held her umbrella over her&nbsp;</p>
<p>while she squinted through the eyepiece.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one corner of the roof there was a covered game area with a row of&nbsp;</p>
<p>children's rides. Midori and I sat next to each other on some kind of&nbsp;</p>
<p>platform and looked at the rain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So talk," Midori said. "You've got something you want to say to me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to make excuses," I said, "but I was really depressed&nbsp;</p>
<p>that time. My brain was all fogged over. Nothing was registering with&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. But one thing became crystal clear to me when I couldn't see you&nbsp;</p>
<p>any more. I realized that the only way I had been able to survive until&nbsp;</p>
<p>then was having you in my life. When I lost you, the pain and&nbsp;</p>
<p>loneliness really got to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't you have any idea how painful and lonely it's been for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>312&nbsp;</p>
<p>without you these past two months?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>This took me completely off guard. "No," I said. "It never occurred to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. I thought you were angry with me and didn't want to see me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How can you be such an idiot? Of course I wanted to see you! I told&nbsp;</p>
<p>you how much I like you! When I like somebody I really like them. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>doesn't turn on and off for me just like that. Don't you realize at least&nbsp;</p>
<p>that much about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, sure, but - "&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's why I was so mad at you! I wanted to give you a good kick up&nbsp;</p>
<p>the arse. I mean, we hadn't seen each other that whole time, and you&nbsp;</p>
<p>were so spaced out thinking about this other girl you didn't even look&nbsp;</p>
<p>at me! How could I not get angry at you? But apart from all that, I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>been feeling for a long time that it would be better for me if I kept&nbsp;</p>
<p>away from you for a while. To get things clear in my head."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What kind of things?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Our relationship, of course. It was getting to the point where I&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoyed being with you far more than being with him. I mean, don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>you think there's something weird about that? And difficult? Of course&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still like him. He's a little self-centred and narrow-minded and kind&nbsp;</p>
<p>of a fascist, but he's got a lot of good points, and he's the first man I&nbsp;</p>
<p>ever felt serious about. But you, well, you're special to me. When I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>with you I feel something is just right. I believe in you. I like you. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't want to let you go. I was getting more and more confused, so I&nbsp;</p>
<p>went to him and asked him what I should do. He told me to stop&nbsp;</p>
<p>seeing you. He said if I was going to see you, I should break up with&nbsp;</p>
<p>him."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what did you do?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I broke up with him. Just like that." Midori put a Marlboro in her&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth, shielded it with her hand as she lit up, and inhaled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Why?'!" she screamed. "Are you crazy? You know the English&nbsp;</p>
<p>subjunctive, you understand trigonometry, you can read Marx, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>313&nbsp;</p>
<p>you don't know the answer to something as simple as that? Why do&nbsp;</p>
<p>you even have to ask? Why do you have to make a girl say something&nbsp;</p>
<p>like this? I like you more than I like him, that's all. I wish I had fallen&nbsp;</p>
<p>in love with somebody a little more handsome, of course. But I didn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fell in love with you!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to speak, but I felt the words catching in my throat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori threw her cigarette into a puddle. "Will you please get that&nbsp;</p>
<p>look off your face? You're gonna make me cry. Don't worry, I know&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're in love with somebody else. I'm not expecting anything from&nbsp;</p>
<p>you. But the least you can do is give me a hug. These have been two&nbsp;</p>
<p>tough months for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put up my umbrella, and we went behind the game area and held&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other close. Our bodies strained against each other, and our lips&nbsp;</p>
<p>met. The smell of the rain clung to her hair and her jeans jacket. Girls'&nbsp;</p>
<p>bodies were so soft and warm! I could feel her breasts pressing against&nbsp;</p>
<p>my chest through our clothing. How long had it been since my last&nbsp;</p>
<p>physical contact with another human being?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The day I last saw you, that night I talked to him, and we broke up,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I love you," I said to her. "From the bottom of my heart. I don't ever&nbsp;</p>
<p>want to let you go again. But there's nothing I can do. I can't make a&nbsp;</p>
<p>move."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because of her?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, have you slept with her?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Once. A year ago."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And you haven't seen her since then?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have seen her: twice. But we didn't do anything." "Why not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn't she love you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's hard to say," I said. "It's really complicated. And&nbsp;</p>
<p>mixed up. And it's been going on for such a long time, I don't know&nbsp;</p>
<p>what's what any more. And neither does she. All I know is, I have a&nbsp;</p>
<p>314&nbsp;</p>
<p>sort of responsibility in all this as a human being, and I can't just turn&nbsp;</p>
<p>my back on it. At least, that's how I feel about it now. Even if she isn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>in love with me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Let me just tell you this, Watanabe," said Midori, pressing her cheek&nbsp;</p>
<p>against my neck. "I'm a real, live girl, with real, live blood gushing&nbsp;</p>
<p>through my veins. You're holding me in your arms and I'm telling you&nbsp;</p>
<p>that I love you. I'm ready to do anything you tell me to do. I may be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>little bit mad, but I'm a good girl, and honest, and I work hard, I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind of cute, I have nice boobs, I'm a good cook, and my father left me&nbsp;</p>
<p>a trust fund. I mean, I'm a real bargain, don't you think? If you don't&nbsp;</p>
<p>take me, I'll end up going somewhere else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I need time," I said. "I need time to think and sort things out, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>make some decisions. I'm sorry, but that's all I can say at this point."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you do love me from the bottom of your heart, right? And&nbsp;</p>
<p>you never want to let me go again, right?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I said it and I meant it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori pulled away from me with a smile on her face. "OK, I'll wait! I&nbsp;</p>
<p>believe in you," she said. "But when you take me, you take only me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when you hold me in your arms, you think only about me. Is that&nbsp;</p>
<p>clear?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I understand exactly."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't care what you do to me, but I don't want you to hurt me. I've&nbsp;</p>
<p>had enough hurt already in my life. More than enough. Now I want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>be happy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I drew her close and kissed her on the mouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Drop the damn umbrella and wrap both your arms around me - hard!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But we'll get soaking wet!"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what? I want you to stop thinking and hold me tight! I've been&nbsp;</p>
<p>waiting two whole months for this!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set down the umbrella and held her close in the rain. The dull rush of&nbsp;</p>
<p>tyres on the highway enveloped us like a fog. The rain fell without a&nbsp;</p>
<p>315&nbsp;</p>
<p>break, without a sound, soaking her hair and mine, running like tears&nbsp;</p>
<p>down our cheeks, down to her denim jacket and my yellow nylon&nbsp;</p>
<p>windcheater, spreading in dark stains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How about going back under the roof?" I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Come to my place. There's nobody home now. We'll both catch colds&nbsp;</p>
<p>like this."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's true."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's as if we've just swum across a river," Midori said, smiling. "What&nbsp;</p>
<p>a great feeling!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>We bought a good-sized towel in the linen department and took turns&nbsp;</p>
<p>going into the bathroom to dry our hair. Then we took the subway,&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the necessary top-up tickets, to her flat in Myogadani. She let me&nbsp;</p>
<p>shower first and then she showered. Lending me a bathrobe to wear&nbsp;</p>
<p>while my clothes dried, Midori changed into a polo shirt and skirt. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>sat at the kitchen table drinking coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me about yourself," Midori said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmm, I don't know, what do you hate?" "Chicken and VD and&nbsp;</p>
<p>barbers who talk too much." "What else?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lonely April nights and lacy telephone covers." "What else?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I can't think of anything else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My boyfriend - which is to say, my ex-boyfriend - had all kinds of&nbsp;</p>
<p>things he hated. Like when I wore too-short skirts, or when I smoked,&nbsp;</p>
<p>or how I got drunk too quickly, or said disgusting things, or criticized&nbsp;</p>
<p>his friends. So if there's anything about me you don't like, just tell me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I'll fix it if I can."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't think of anything," I said after giving it some thought. "There's&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like everything you wear, and I like what you do and say and how&nbsp;</p>
<p>you walk and how you get drunk. Everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean I'm really OK just the way I am?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>316&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know how you could change, so you must be fine the way you&nbsp;</p>
<p>are."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How much do you love me?" Midori asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Enough to melt all the tigers in the world to butter," I said. "Far out,"&nbsp;</p>
<p>she said with a hint of satisfaction. "Will you hold me again?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got into her bed and held each other, kissing as the sound of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>rain filled our ears. Then we talked about everything from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>formation of the universe to our preferences in the hardness of boiled&nbsp;</p>
<p>eggs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wonder what ants do on rainy days?" Midori asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No idea," I said. "They're hard workers, so they probably spend the&nbsp;</p>
<p>day cleaning house or stock-taking."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If they work so hard, why don't they evolve? They've been the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>for ever."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said. "Maybe their body structure isn't suited to&nbsp;</p>
<p>evolving - compared with monkeys, say."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, there's a lot of stuff you don't know. I thought you&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a big world out there," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"High mountains, deep oceans," Midori said. She put her hand inside&nbsp;</p>
<p>my bathrobe and took hold of my erection. Then, with a gulp, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said, "Hey, Watanabe, joking aside, this isn't gonna work. I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>never get this big, hard thing inside me. No way."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're kidding," I said with a sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yup," she said, giggling. "Don't worry. It'll be just fine. I'm sure it'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>fit. Er, mind if I have a look?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Feel free."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori burrowed under the covers and groped me all over down there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>stretching the skin of my penis, weighing my testicles in the palm of&nbsp;</p>
<p>her hand. Then she poked her head out and sighed. "I love it!" she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said. "No flattery intended! I really love it!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thank you," I said with simple gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>317&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But really, Watanabe, you don't want to do it with me, do you - until&nbsp;</p>
<p>you get all that business straightened out?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's no way I don't want to do it with you," I said. "I'm going&nbsp;</p>
<p>crazy I want to do it so bad. But it just wouldn't be right."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're so damned stubborn! If I were you, I'd just do it - then think&nbsp;</p>
<p>about it afterwards."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You would?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Only kidding," Midori said in a tiny voice. "I probably wouldn't do it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>either, if I were you. And that's what I love about you. That's what I&nbsp;</p>
<p>really really love about you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How much do you love me?" I asked, but she didn't answer. Instead,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she pressed against me, put her lips on my nipple and began to move&nbsp;</p>
<p>the hand that was wrapped around my penis. The first thing that&nbsp;</p>
<p>occurred to me was how different it was to the way Naoko moved her&nbsp;</p>
<p>hand. Both were gentle and wonderful, but something was different&nbsp;</p>
<p>about the way they did it, and so it felt like a totally different&nbsp;</p>
<p>experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, I bet you're thinking about that other girl."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not true," I lied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because I would really hate that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't think about anybody else," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Want to touch my breasts, or down there?" Midori asked. "Oh wow,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to, but I'd better not. If we do all those&nbsp;</p>
<p>things at once, it'll be too much for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori nodded and rustled around under the covers, pulling&nbsp;</p>
<p>her panties off and holding them against the tip of my penis. "You can&nbsp;</p>
<p>come on these," she said. "But it'll make a mess of them."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Stop it, will you? You're gonna make me cry," said Midori, a if on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the verge of tears. "All I have to do is wash them. So don't hold back,&nbsp;</p>
<p>just let yourself come all you want. If you're worried about my&nbsp;</p>
<p>318&nbsp;</p>
<p>panties, buy me a new pair. Or are they going to keep you from&nbsp;</p>
<p>coming because they're mine?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said. "Go on then, let go."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was through, Midori inspected my semen. "Wow, that's a huge&nbsp;</p>
<p>amount!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Too much?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nah, it's OK, silly. Come all you want," she said with a smile. Then&nbsp;</p>
<p>she kissed me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the evening, Midori did some shopping in the neighbourhood and&nbsp;</p>
<p>made dinner. We ate tempura and rice with green peas at the kitchen&nbsp;</p>
<p>table, and washed it all down with beer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Eat a lot and make lots of semen," Midori said. "Then I'll be nice and&nbsp;</p>
<p>help you get rid of it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thanks very much," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know all sorts of ways to do it. I learned from the women's&nbsp;</p>
<p>magazines when we had the bookshop. Once they had this special&nbsp;</p>
<p>edition all about how to take care of your husband so he won't cheat&nbsp;</p>
<p>on you while you're pregnant and can't have sex. There's tons of ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wanna try 'em?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can hardly wait," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to Midori, I bought a newspaper at the station,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but when I opened it on the train, I realized I had absolutely no desire&nbsp;</p>
<p>to read a paper and in fact couldn't understand what it said. All I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>do was glare at the incomprehensible page of print and wonder what&nbsp;</p>
<p>was going to happen to me from now on, and how the things around&nbsp;</p>
<p>me would be changing. I felt as if the world was pulsating every now&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then. I sighed deeply and closed my eyes. As regards what I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>done that day, I felt not the slightest regret; I knew for certain that if I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to do it all over again, I would live this day in exactly the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>way. I would hold Midori tight on the roof in the rain; I would get&nbsp;</p>
<p>soaking wet with her; and I would let her fingers bring me to climax in&nbsp;</p>
<p>319&nbsp;</p>
<p>her bed. I had no doubts about those things. I loved Midori, and I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy that she had come back to me. The two of us could make it, that&nbsp;</p>
<p>was certain. As Midori herself had said, she was a real, live girl with&nbsp;</p>
<p>blood in her veins, and she was putting her warm body in my arms. It&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been all I could do to suppress the intense desire I had to strip her&nbsp;</p>
<p>naked, throw open her body, and sink myself in her warmth. There&nbsp;</p>
<p>was no way I could have made myself stop her once she was holding&nbsp;</p>
<p>my penis and moving her hand. I wanted her to do it, she wanted to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>it, and we were in love. Who could have stopped such a thing? It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>true: I loved Midori. And I had probably known as much for a while. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had just been avoiding the conclusion for a very long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem was that I could never explain these developments to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko. It would have been hard enough at any point, but with Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>in her present condition, there was no way I could tell her I had fallen&nbsp;</p>
<p>in love with another girl. And besides, I still loved Naoko. As twisted&nbsp;</p>
<p>as that love might be, I did love her. Somewhere inside me there was&nbsp;</p>
<p>still preserved a broad, open space, untouched, for Naoko and no one&nbsp;</p>
<p>else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I could do was write a letter to Reiko that confessed&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything with total honesty. At home, I sat on the veranda, watching&nbsp;</p>
<p>the rain pour down on the garden at night, and assembling phrases in&nbsp;</p>
<p>my head. Then I went to my desk and wrote the letter. It is almost&nbsp;</p>
<p>unbearable to me that I now have to write a letter like this to you, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>began. I summarized my relationship with Midori and explained what&nbsp;</p>
<p>had happened that day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have always loved Naoko, and I still love her. But there is a decisive&nbsp;</p>
<p>finality to what exists between Midori and me. It has an irresistible&nbsp;</p>
<p>power that is bound to sweep me into the future. What I feel for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko is a tremendously quiet and gentle and transparent love, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I feel for Midori is a wholly different emotion. It stands and&nbsp;</p>
<p>walks on its own, living and breathing and throbbing and shaking me&nbsp;</p>
<p>320&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the roots of my being. I don't know what to do. I'm confused. I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>not trying to make excuses for myself, but I do believe that I have&nbsp;</p>
<p>lived as sincerely as I know how. I have never lied to anyone, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>have taken care over the years not to hurt other people. And yet I find&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself tossed into this labyrinth. How can this be? I can't explain it. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't know what I should do. Can you tell me, Reiko? You're the only&nbsp;</p>
<p>one I can turn to for advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted the letter that night by special delivery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko's answer came five days later, dated 17 June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me start with the good news. Naoko has been improving far more&nbsp;</p>
<p>rapidly than anyone could have expected. I talked to her once on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>phone, and she spoke with real lucidity. She may even be able to come&nbsp;</p>
<p>back here before long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, about you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you take everything too seriously. Loving another person is a&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful thing, and if that love is sincere, no one ends up tossed into&nbsp;</p>
<p>a labyrinth. You have to have more faith in yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice to you is very simple. First of all, if you are drawn so&nbsp;</p>
<p>strongly to this Midori person, it is only natural for you to have fallen&nbsp;</p>
<p>in love with her. It might go well, or it might not. But love is like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you fall in love, the natural thing to do is give yourself to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what I think. It's just a form of sincerity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, as to whether or not you should have sex with Midori, that is&nbsp;</p>
<p>for you to work out. I can't say a thing. Talk it over with Midori and&nbsp;</p>
<p>reach your own conclusion, one that makes sense to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, don't tell any of this to Naoko. If things should develop to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>point where you absolutely have to tell her, then you and I will come&nbsp;</p>
<p>up with a good plan together. So now, just keep it quiet. Leave it to&nbsp;</p>
<p>me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>321&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth thing I have to say is that you have been such a great&nbsp;</p>
<p>source of strength for Naoko that even if you no longer have the&nbsp;</p>
<p>feelings of a lover towards her, there is still a lot you can do for her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So don't brood over everything in that super-serious way of yours. All&nbsp;</p>
<p>of us (by which I mean all of us, both normal and not-so-normal) are&nbsp;</p>
<p>imperfect human beings living in an imperfect world. We don't live&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the mechanical precision of a bank account or by measuring all&nbsp;</p>
<p>our lines and angles with rulers and protractors. Am I right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My own personal feeling is that Midori sounds like a great girl. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>understand just reading your letter why you would be drawn to her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I understand, too, why you would also be drawn to Naoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's nothing the least bit sinful about it. Things like that happen all&nbsp;</p>
<p>the time in this great big world of ours. It's like taking a boat out on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>beautiful lake on a beautiful day and thinking both the sky and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>lake are beautiful. So stop eating yourself up. Things will go where&nbsp;</p>
<p>they're supposed to go if you just let them take their natural course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for&nbsp;</p>
<p>them to be hurt. Life is like that. I know I sound like I'm preaching&nbsp;</p>
<p>from a pulpit, but it's about time you learned to live like this. You try&nbsp;</p>
<p>too hard to make life fit your way of doing things. If you don't want to&nbsp;</p>
<p>spend time in an insane asylum, you have to open up a little more and&nbsp;</p>
<p>let yourself go with life's natural flow. I'm just a powerless and&nbsp;</p>
<p>imperfect woman, but still there are times when I think to myself how&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful life can be! Believe me, it's true! So stop what you're doing&nbsp;</p>
<p>this minute and get happy. Work at making yourself happy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, I do feel sorry that you and Naoko could not see&nbsp;</p>
<p>things through to a happy ending. But who can say what's best? That's&nbsp;</p>
<p>why you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where&nbsp;</p>
<p>you find it, and not worry about other people too much. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>experience tells me that we get no more than two or three such&nbsp;</p>
<p>chances in a lifetime, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of&nbsp;</p>
<p>our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>322&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm playing the guitar every day for no one in particular. It seems a bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>pointless. I don't like dark, rainy nights, either. I hope I'll have another&nbsp;</p>
<p>chance to play my guitar and eat grapes with you and Naoko in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>room with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah, well, until then -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko Ishida&nbsp;</p>
<p>323&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko wrote to me several times after Naoko's death. It wasn't my&nbsp;</p>
<p>fault, she said. It was nobody's fault, any more than you could blame&nbsp;</p>
<p>someone for the rain. But I never answered her. What could I have&nbsp;</p>
<p>said? What good would it have done? Naoko no longer existed in this&nbsp;</p>
<p>world; she had become a handful of ashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They held a quiet funeral for Naoko in Kobe at the end of August, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>when it was over, I went back to Tokyo. I told my landlord I would be&nbsp;</p>
<p>away for a while and my boss at the Italian restaurant that I wouldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>be coming in to work. To Midori I wrote a short note: I couldn't say&nbsp;</p>
<p>anything just yet, but I hoped she would wait for me a little longer. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>spent the next three days in cinemas, and after I had seen every new&nbsp;</p>
<p>film in Tokyo, I packed my rucksack, took out all my savings from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>bank, went to Shinjuku Station, and got the first express train I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>find going out of town.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where I went on my travels, it's impossible for me to recall. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember the sights and sounds and smells clearly enough, but the&nbsp;</p>
<p>names of the towns are gone, as well as any sense of the order in&nbsp;</p>
<p>which I travelled from place to place. I would move from town to&nbsp;</p>
<p>town by train or bus or hitching a lift in a lorry, spreading out my&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleeping bag in empty car parks or stations or parks or on river banks&nbsp;</p>
<p>or the seashore. I once persuaded them to let me sleep in the corner of&nbsp;</p>
<p>a local police station, and another time slept alongside a graveyard. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't care where I slept, provided I was out of people's way and could&nbsp;</p>
<p>stay in my sleeping bag as long as I felt like it. Exhausted from&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking, I would crawl into it, gulp down some cheap whisky, and fall&nbsp;</p>
<p>324&nbsp;</p>
<p>fast asleep. In nice towns, people would bring me food and mosquito&nbsp;</p>
<p>coils, and in not-so-nice towns, people would call the police and have&nbsp;</p>
<p>me chased out of the parks. It made no difference to me one way or&nbsp;</p>
<p>another. All I wanted was to put myself to sleep in towns I didn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I ran low on money, I would work as a labourer for a few days&nbsp;</p>
<p>until I had what I needed. There was always work for me to do. I just&nbsp;</p>
<p>kept moving from one town to the next, no destination in mind. The&nbsp;</p>
<p>world was big and full of weird things and strange people. One time I&nbsp;</p>
<p>called Midori because I had to hear her voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Term started a long time ago, you know," she said. "Some courses&nbsp;</p>
<p>are even asking for papers already. What are you going to do? Do you&nbsp;</p>
<p>realize you've been out of touch for three whole weeks now? Where&nbsp;</p>
<p>are you? What are you doing?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry, but I can't go back to Tokyo yet. Not yet."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And that's all you're going to tell me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's really nothing more I can say at this point. Maybe in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>.."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori hung up without a word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went on with my travels. Every now and then I'd stay at a dosshouse&nbsp;</p>
<p>and have a bath and shave. What I saw in the mirror looked terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sun had dried out my skin, my eyes were sunken, and odd stains&nbsp;</p>
<p>and cuts marked my cheekbones. I looked as if I had just crawled out&nbsp;</p>
<p>of a cave somewhere, but it was me after all. It was me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By that time, I was moving down the coast, as far from Tokyo as I&nbsp;</p>
<p>could get - maybe in Tottori or the hidden side of Hyogo. Walking&nbsp;</p>
<p>along the seashore was easy. I could always find a comfortable place&nbsp;</p>
<p>to sleep in the sand. I'd make a fire from driftwood and roast some&nbsp;</p>
<p>dried fish I bought from a local fisherman. Then I'd swallow some&nbsp;</p>
<p>whisky and listen to the waves while I thought about Naoko. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>too strange to think that she was dead and no longer part of this world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't absorb the truth of it. I couldn't believe it. I had heard the&nbsp;</p>
<p>325&nbsp;</p>
<p>nails being driven into the lid of her coffin, but I still couldn't adjust to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the fact that she had returned to nothingness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the image of her was still too vivid in my memory. I could still&nbsp;</p>
<p>see her enclosing my penis in her mouth, her hair falling across my&nbsp;</p>
<p>belly. I could still feel her warmth, her breath against me, and that&nbsp;</p>
<p>helpless moment when I could do nothing but come. I could bring all&nbsp;</p>
<p>this back as clearly as if it had happened only five minutes ago, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>felt sure that Naoko was still beside me, that I could just reach out and&nbsp;</p>
<p>touch her. But no, she wasn't there; her flesh no longer existed in this&nbsp;</p>
<p>world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nights when it was impossible for me to sleep, images of Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>would come back to me. There was no way I could stop them. Too&nbsp;</p>
<p>many memories of her were crammed inside me, and as soon as one of&nbsp;</p>
<p>them found the slightest opening, the rest would force their way out in&nbsp;</p>
<p>an endless stream, an unstoppable flood: Naoko in her yellow raincape&nbsp;</p>
<p>cleaning the aviary and carrying the feed bag that rainy morning; the&nbsp;</p>
<p>caved-in birthday cake and the feel of Naoko's tears soaking through&nbsp;</p>
<p>my shirt (yes, it had been raining then, too); Naoko walking beside me&nbsp;</p>
<p>in winter wearing her camel-hair coat; Naoko touching the hairslide&nbsp;</p>
<p>she always wore; Naoko peering at me with those incredibly clear&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes of hers; Naoko sitting on the sofa, legs drawn up beneath her blue&nbsp;</p>
<p>nightdress, chin resting on her knees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The memories would slam against me like the waves of an incoming&nbsp;</p>
<p>tide, sweeping my body along to some strange new place - a place&nbsp;</p>
<p>where I lived with the dead. There Naoko lived, and I could speak&nbsp;</p>
<p>with her and hold her in my arms. Death in that place was not a&nbsp;</p>
<p>decisive element that brought life to an end. There, death was but one&nbsp;</p>
<p>of many elements comprising life. There Naoko lived with death&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside her. And to me she said, "Don't worry, it's only death. Don't let&nbsp;</p>
<p>it bother you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt no sadness in that strange place. Death was death, and Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>was Naoko. "What's the problem?" she asked me with a bashful smile,&nbsp;</p>
<p>326&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm here, aren't I?" Her familiar little gestures soothed my heart like a&nbsp;</p>
<p>healing balm. "If this is death," I thought to myself, "then death is not&nbsp;</p>
<p>so bad." "It's true," said Naoko, "death is nothing much. It's just death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are so easy for me here." Naoko spoke to me in the spaces&nbsp;</p>
<p>between the crashing of the dark waves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, though, the tide would pull back, and I would be left on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the beach alone. Powerless, I could go nowhere; sadness itself would&nbsp;</p>
<p>envelop me in deep darkness until the tears came. I felt less that I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>crying than that the tears were simply oozing out of me like&nbsp;</p>
<p>perspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had learned one thing from Kizuki's death, and I believed that I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>made it a part of myself in the form of a philosophy: "Death exists, not&nbsp;</p>
<p>as the opposite but as a part of life."&nbsp;</p>
<p>By living our lives, we nurture death. True as this might be, it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>only one of the truths we had to learn. What I learned from Naoko's&nbsp;</p>
<p>death was this: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a&nbsp;</p>
<p>loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure&nbsp;</p>
<p>that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and&nbsp;</p>
<p>learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing&nbsp;</p>
<p>the next sadness that comes to us without warning. Hearing the waves&nbsp;</p>
<p>at night, listening to the sound of the wind, day after day I focused on&nbsp;</p>
<p>these thoughts of mine. Knapsack on my back, sand in my hair, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>moved farther and farther west, surviving on a diet of whisky, bread&nbsp;</p>
<p>and water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One windy evening, as I lay wrapped in my sleeping bag, weeping, by&nbsp;</p>
<p>the side of an abandoned hulk, a young fisherman passed by and&nbsp;</p>
<p>offered me a cigarette. I accepted it and had my first smoke in over a&nbsp;</p>
<p>year. He asked why I was crying, and almost by reflex I told him that&nbsp;</p>
<p>my mother had died. I couldn't take the sadness, I said, and so I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the road. He expressed his deep sympathy and brought a big bottle&nbsp;</p>
<p>of sake and two glasses from his house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>327&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wind tore along the sand beach as we sat there drinking. He told&nbsp;</p>
<p>me that he had lost his mother when he was 16. Never healthy, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>had worn herself out working from morning to night. I half-listened to&nbsp;</p>
<p>him, sipping my sake and grunting in response every now and then. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>felt as if I were hearing a story from some far-off world. What the hell&nbsp;</p>
<p>was he talking about? I wondered, and all of a sudden I was filled with&nbsp;</p>
<p>intense rage: I wanted to strangle him. Who gives a shit about your&nbsp;</p>
<p>mother? I've lost Naoko! Her beautiful flesh has vanished from this&nbsp;</p>
<p>world! Why the hell are you telling me about your fucking mother?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my rage disappeared as quickly as it had flared up. I closed my&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes and went on half-listening to the fisherman's endless talk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually he asked me if I had eaten. No, I said, but in my rucksack I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had bread and cheese, a tomato and a piece of chocolate. What had I&nbsp;</p>
<p>eaten for lunch? he asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bread and cheese, tomato and chocolate, I answered. "Wait here," he&nbsp;</p>
<p>said and ran off. I tried to stop him, but he disappeared into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>darkness without looking back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I could do was go on drinking my sake. The shore was littered&nbsp;</p>
<p>with paper flecks from fireworks that had been exploded on the sand,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and waves crashed against the beach with a mad roar. A scrawny dog&nbsp;</p>
<p>came up wagging its tail and sniffing around my little campfire for&nbsp;</p>
<p>something to eat but eventually gave up and wandered away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young fisherman came back half an hour later with two boxes of&nbsp;</p>
<p>sushi and a new bottle of sake. I should eat the top box straight away&nbsp;</p>
<p>because that had fish in it, he said, but the bottom box had only nori&nbsp;</p>
<p>rolls and deep-fried tofu skins so they would last all tomorrow. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>filled both our glasses with sake from the new bottle. I thanked him&nbsp;</p>
<p>and polished off the whole top box myself, though it had more than&nbsp;</p>
<p>enough for two. After we had drunk as much sake as we could&nbsp;</p>
<p>manage, he offered to put me up for the night, but when I said I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>rather sleep alone on the beach, he left it at that. As he stood to go, he&nbsp;</p>
<p>took a folded ?5,000 note from his pocket and shoved it into the&nbsp;</p>
<p>328&nbsp;</p>
<p>pocket of my shirt. "Here," he said, "get yourself some healthy food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You look awful." I said he had done more than enough for me and that&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't accept money on top of everything else, but he refused to&nbsp;</p>
<p>take it back. "It's not money," he said, "it's my feelings. Don't think&nbsp;</p>
<p>about it too much, just take it." All I could do was thank him and&nbsp;</p>
<p>accept it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he had gone, I suddenly thought about my old girlfriend, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>one I had first slept with in my last year of school. Chills ran through&nbsp;</p>
<p>me as I realized how badly I had treated her. I had hardly ever thought&nbsp;</p>
<p>about her thoughts or feelings or the pain I had caused her. She was&nbsp;</p>
<p>such a sweet and gentle thing, but at the time I had taken her&nbsp;</p>
<p>sweetness for granted and later hardly gave her a second thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was she doing now? I wondered. And had she forgiven me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wave of nausea came over me, and I vomited by the old ship. My&nbsp;</p>
<p>head hurt from too much sake, and I felt bad about having lied to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>fisherman and taken his money. It was time for me to go back to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo, I decided; I couldn't keep this up for ever. I stuffed my&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleeping bag into my rucksack, slipped my arms through the straps&nbsp;</p>
<p>and walked to the local railway station. I told the man at the ticket</p>
<p>office window that I wanted to get to Tokyo as soon as possible. He&nbsp;</p>
<p>checked his timetable and said I could make it as far as Osaka by&nbsp;</p>
<p>morning if I transferred from one night train to another, then I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>take the bullet train from there. I thanked him and used the x"5,000&nbsp;</p>
<p>note the fisherman gave me to buy a ticket to Tokyo. Waiting for the&nbsp;</p>
<p>train, I bought a newspaper and checked the date: 2 October, 1970. So&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been travelling for a full month. I knew I had to go back to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The month of travelling neither lifted my spirits nor softened the blow&nbsp;</p>
<p>of Naoko's death. I arrived back in Tokyo in pretty much the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>state in which I had left. I couldn't even bring myself to phone Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could I say to her? How could I begin? "It's all over now; you&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I can be happy together"? No, that was out of the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>329&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I might phrase it, though, the facts were the same: Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>was dead, and Midori was still here. Naoko was a mound of white ash,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Midori was a living, breathing human being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was overcome with a sense of my own defilement. Though I&nbsp;</p>
<p>returned to Tokyo I did nothing for days but shut myself up in my&nbsp;</p>
<p>room. My memory remained fixed on the dead rather than the living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rooms I had set aside in there for Naoko were shuttered, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>furniture draped in white, the windowsills dusty. I spent the better part&nbsp;</p>
<p>of each day in those rooms. And I thought about Kizuki. "So you&nbsp;</p>
<p>finally made Naoko yours," I heard myself telling him. "Oh, well, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>was yours to begin with. Now, maybe, she's where she belongs. But in&nbsp;</p>
<p>this world, in this imperfect world of the living, I did the best I could&nbsp;</p>
<p>for Naoko. I tried to establish a new life for the two of us. But forget&nbsp;</p>
<p>it, Kizuki. I'm giving her to you. You're the one she chose, after all. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>woods as dark as the depths of her own heart, she hanged herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, you dragged a part of me into the world of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dead, and now Naoko has dragged another part of me into that world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like the caretaker of a museum - a huge, empty&nbsp;</p>
<p>museum where no one ever comes, and I'm watching over it for no&nbsp;</p>
<p>one but myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth day after my return to Tokyo, a letter came from Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Special delivery. It was a simple note: I haven't been able&nbsp;</p>
<p>to get in touch with you for weeks, and I'm worried. Please call me. At&nbsp;</p>
<p>9 a.m. and 9 p.m. I will be waiting by the telephone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called her at nine o'clock that night. Reiko picked up after one ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"More or less," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I come and visit you the day after tomorrow?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Visit me? You mean here in Tokyo?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's exactly what I mean. I want to have a good, long talk with&nbsp;</p>
<p>you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>330&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're leaving the sanatorium?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's the only way I can come and see you, isn't it? Anyway, it's about&nbsp;</p>
<p>time for me to get out of this place. I've been here eight years, after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they keep me any longer, I'll start to rot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found it difficult to speak. After a short silence, Reiko went on: "I'll&nbsp;</p>
<p>be on the 3.20 bullet train the day after tomorrow. Will you meet me&nbsp;</p>
<p>at the station? Do you still remember what I look like? Or have you&nbsp;</p>
<p>lost interest in me now that Naoko's dead?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way," I said. "See you at Tokyo Station the day after tomorrow at&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.20."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You won't have any trouble recognizing me. I'm the old lady with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>guitar case. There aren't many of those."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in fact, I had no trouble finding Reiko in the crowd. She wore a&nbsp;</p>
<p>man's tweed jacket, white trousers, and red trainers. Her hair was as&nbsp;</p>
<p>short as ever, with the usual clumps sticking up. In her right hand she&nbsp;</p>
<p>held a brown leather suitcase, and in her left a black guitar case. She&nbsp;</p>
<p>gave me a big, wrinkly smile the moment she spotted me, and I found&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself grinning back. I took her suitcase and walked beside her to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>train for the western suburbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, how long have you been wearing that awful face? Or&nbsp;</p>
<p>is that the 'in' look in Tokyo these days?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I was travelling for a while, ate junk all the time," I said. "How did&nbsp;</p>
<p>you find the bullet train?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Awful!" she said. "You can't open the windows. I wanted to buy a&nbsp;</p>
<p>box lunch from one of the station buffets."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They sell them on board, you know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, overpriced plastic sandwiches. A starving horse wouldn't touch&nbsp;</p>
<p>that stuff. I always used to enjoy the boxed lunches at Gotenba&nbsp;</p>
<p>Station."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, before the bullet train."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, I'm from once upon a time before the bullet train!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>331&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the train out to Kichijoji, Reiko watched the Musashino landscape&nbsp;</p>
<p>passing the window with all the curiosity of a tourist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Has it changed much in eight years?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You don't know what I'm feeling now, do you, Watanabe?" "No, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm scared," she said. "So scared, I could go crazy just like that. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't know what I'm supposed to do, flung out here all by myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She paused. "But 'Go crazy just like that.' Kind of a cool expression,&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't you think?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I smiled and took her hand. "Don't worry," I said. "You'll be OK. Your&nbsp;</p>
<p>own strength got you this far."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It wasn't my own strength that got me out of that place," Reiko said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It was Naoko and you. I couldn't stand it there without Naoko, and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had to come to Tokyo to talk to you. That's all. If nothing had&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened I probably would have spent the rest of my life there."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do from now on?" I asked Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm going to Asahikawa," she said. "Way up in the wilds of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hokkaido! An old college friend of mine runs a music school there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and she's been asking me for two or three years now to help her out. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>told her it was too cold for me. I mean, I finally get my freedom back&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I'm supposed to go to Asahikawa? It's hard to get excited about a&nbsp;</p>
<p>place like that - some hole in the ground."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's not so awful," I said, laughing. "I've been there. It's not a bad little&nbsp;</p>
<p>town. Got its own special atmosphere." "Are you sure?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Absolutely. It's much better than staying in Tokyo."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, well," she said. "I don't have anywhere else to go, and I've&nbsp;</p>
<p>already sent my stuff there. Hey, Watanabe, promise me you'll come&nbsp;</p>
<p>and visit me in Asahikawa."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course I will. But do you have to leave straight away?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't you stay in Tokyo for a while?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd like to hang around here a few days if I can. Can you put me up? I&nbsp;</p>
<p>332&nbsp;</p>
<p>won't get in your way."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No problem," I said. "I have a big closet I can sleep in, in&nbsp;</p>
<p>my sleeping bag."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't do that to you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, really. It's a huge closet."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko tapped out a rhythm on the guitar case between her legs. "I'm&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably going to have to condition myself a little before I go to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asahikawa. I'm just not used to being in the outside world. There's a&nbsp;</p>
<p>lot of stuff I don't get, and I'm nervous. Think you can help me out a&nbsp;</p>
<p>little? You're the only one I can ask."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll do anything I can to help you," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I hope I'm not getting in your way," she said. "I don't have any way&nbsp;</p>
<p>for you to get in," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She looked at me and turned up the corners of her mouth in a smile&nbsp;</p>
<p>but said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hardly talked the rest of the way to Kichijoji Station or on the bus&nbsp;</p>
<p>back to my place. We traded a few random comments on the changes&nbsp;</p>
<p>in Tokyo and Reiko's time at the College of Music and my one trip to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asahikawa, but said nothing about Naoko. Ten months had gone by&nbsp;</p>
<p>since I last saw Reiko, but walking by her side I felt strangely calmed&nbsp;</p>
<p>and comforted. This was a familiar feeling, I thought, and then it&nbsp;</p>
<p>occurred to me it was the way I used to feel when walking the streets&nbsp;</p>
<p>of Tokyo with Naoko. And just as Naoko and I had shared the dead&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki, Reiko and I shared the dead Naoko. This thought made it&nbsp;</p>
<p>impossible for me to go on talking. Reiko continued speaking for a&nbsp;</p>
<p>while, but when she realized that I wasn't saying anything, she also&nbsp;</p>
<p>fell silent. Neither of us said a word on the bus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was one of those early autumn afternoons when the light is sharp&nbsp;</p>
<p>and clear, exactly as it had been a year earlier when I visited Naoko in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kyoto. The clouds were white and as narrow as bones, the sky wide&nbsp;</p>
<p>open and high. The fragrance of the breeze, the tone of the light, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>333&nbsp;</p>
<p>tiny flowers in the grass, the subtle reverberations that accompanied&nbsp;</p>
<p>sounds: all these told me that autumn had come again, increasing the&nbsp;</p>
<p>distance between me and the dead with each cycle of the seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kizuki was still 17 and Naoko 21: for ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, what a relief to come to a place like this!" Reiko said, looking all&nbsp;</p>
<p>around as we stepped off the bus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because there's nothing here," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I led her through the back gate through the garden to my cottage,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko was impressed by everything she saw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is terrific!" she said. "You made these shelves and the desk?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yep," I said, pouring tea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're obviously good with your hands. And you keep the place so&nbsp;</p>
<p>clean!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Storm Trooper's influence," I said. "He turned me into a cleanliness&nbsp;</p>
<p>freak. Not that my landlord's complaining."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, your landlord! I ought to introduce myself to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's his place on the other side of the garden, I suppose." "Introduce&nbsp;</p>
<p>yourself to him? What for?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you mean "what for'? Some weird old lady shows up in your&nbsp;</p>
<p>place and starts playing the guitar, he's going to wonder what's going&nbsp;</p>
<p>on. Better to start out on the right foot. I even brought a box of tea&nbsp;</p>
<p>sweets for him." "Very clever," I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The wisdom that comes with age. I'm going to tell him I'm your aunt&nbsp;</p>
<p>on your mother's side, visiting from Kyoto, so don't contradict me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The age difference comes in handy at times like this. Nobody's going&nbsp;</p>
<p>to get suspicious."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko took the box of sweets from her bag and went off to pay her&nbsp;</p>
<p>respects. I sat on the veranda, drinking another cup of tea and playing&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the cat. Twenty minutes went by, and when Reiko finally came&nbsp;</p>
<p>back, she pulled a tin of rice crackers from her bag and said it was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>present for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>334&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What were you talking about for so long?" I asked, munching on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>cracker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You, of course," said Reiko, cradling the cat and rubbing her cheek&nbsp;</p>
<p>against it. "He says you're a very proper young man, a serious&nbsp;</p>
<p>student."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Are you sure he was talking about me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that he was talking about&nbsp;</p>
<p>you," she said with a laugh. Then, noticing my guitar, she picked it up,&nbsp;</p>
<p>adjusted the tuning, and played Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Desafinado".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been months since I last heard Reiko's guitar, and it gave me&nbsp;</p>
<p>that old, warm feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You practising the guitar?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It was kicking around the landlord's storehouse, so I borrowed it and&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plunk on it once in a while. That's all."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'll give you a lesson later. Absolutely free." Reiko put down the&nbsp;</p>
<p>guitar and took off her tweed jacket. Sitting against the veranda post,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she smoked a cigarette. She was wearing a madras check short-sleeve&nbsp;</p>
<p>shirt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nice shirt, don't you think?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is," I said. In fact it was a good-looking shirt with a handsome&nbsp;</p>
<p>pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's Naoko's," said Reiko. "I bet you didn't know we were the same&nbsp;</p>
<p>size. Especially when she first came to the sanatorium. She put on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>little weight after that, but still we were pretty much the same size:&nbsp;</p>
<p>blouses, trousers, shoes, hats. Bras were about the only thing we&nbsp;</p>
<p>couldn't share. I've got practically nothing here. So we were always&nbsp;</p>
<p>swapping clothes. Actually, it was more like joint ownership."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, I saw that Reiko's build was almost&nbsp;</p>
<p>identical to Naoko's. Because of the shape of her face and her thin&nbsp;</p>
<p>arms and legs, she had always given me the impression of being&nbsp;</p>
<p>smaller and slimmer than Naoko, but in fact she was surprisingly&nbsp;</p>
<p>solid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>335&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The jacket and trousers are hers, too," said Reiko. "It's all hers. Does&nbsp;</p>
<p>it bother you to see me wearing her stuff?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all," I said. "I'm sure Naoko would be glad to have somebody&nbsp;</p>
<p>wearing her clothes - especially you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's strange," Reiko said with a little snap of the fingers. "Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>didn't leave a will or anything - except where her clothes were&nbsp;</p>
<p>concerned. She scribbled one line on a memo pad on her desk. "Please&nbsp;</p>
<p>give all my clothes to Reiko.' She was a funny one, don't you think?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would she be concerned about her clothes of all things when&nbsp;</p>
<p>she's getting ready to die? Who gives a damn about clothes? She must&nbsp;</p>
<p>have had tons of other things she wanted to say."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Maybe not," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Puffing on her cigarette, Reiko seemed lost in thought. Then she said,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You want to hear the whole story, in order, I suppose."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do," I said. "Please tell me everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tests at the hospital in Osaka showed that Naoko's condition was&nbsp;</p>
<p>improving for the moment but that she should stay there on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>somewhat longer-term basis so that they could&nbsp;</p>
<p>continue the intensive therapy for its future benefits. I told you that&nbsp;</p>
<p>much in my letter - the one I sent you somewhere around the tenth of&nbsp;</p>
<p>August."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right. I read that letter."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, on the 24th of August I got a call from Naoko's mother asking&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it was OK for Naoko to visit me at the sanatorium. Naoko wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>pack the things she had left with me and, because she wouldn't be able&nbsp;</p>
<p>to see me for a while, she wanted to have a nice long talk with me, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>perhaps spend a night in our flat. I said that would be fine. I wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>see her really badly and to have a talk with her. So Naoko and her&nbsp;</p>
<p>mother arrived the next day, the 25th, in a taxi. The three of us worked&nbsp;</p>
<p>together, packing Naoko's things and chatting away. Late in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>afternoon, Naoko said it would be OK for her mother to go home, that&nbsp;</p>
<p>336&nbsp;</p>
<p>she'd be fine, so they called a taxi and the mother left. We weren't&nbsp;</p>
<p>worried at all because Naoko seemed to be in such good spirits. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>fact, until then I had been very worried. I had been expecting her to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>depressed and worn out and emaciated. I mean, I knew how much the&nbsp;</p>
<p>testing and therapy and stuff they do at those hospitals can take it out&nbsp;</p>
<p>of you, so I had some real doubts about this visit. But one look at her&nbsp;</p>
<p>was all it took to convince me she'd be OK. She looked a lot healthier&nbsp;</p>
<p>than I had expected and she was smiling and joking and talking much&nbsp;</p>
<p>more normally than when I had seen her last. She had been to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>hairdresser's and was showing off her new hairdo. So I thought there&nbsp;</p>
<p>would be nothing to worry about even if her mother left us alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naoko told me that this time she was going to let those hospital&nbsp;</p>
<p>doctors cure her once and for all, and I said that that would probably&nbsp;</p>
<p>be the best thing to do. So then the two of us went out for a walk,&nbsp;</p>
<p>talking all the time, mainly about the future. Naoko told me that what&nbsp;</p>
<p>she'd really like was for the two of us to get out of the sanatorium and&nbsp;</p>
<p>live together somewhere."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Live together? You and Naoko?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's right," said Reiko with a little shrug. "So I told her it sounded&nbsp;</p>
<p>good to me, but what about Watanabe? And she said, "Don't worry,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll get everything straight with him.' That's all. Then she talked about&nbsp;</p>
<p>where she and I would live and what we'd do, that kind of thing. After&nbsp;</p>
<p>that we went to the aviary and played with the birds."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a beer from the fridge and opened it. Reiko lit another cigarette,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the cat sound asleep in her lap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That girl had everything worked out for herself. I'm sure that's why&nbsp;</p>
<p>she was so full of energy and smiling and healthylooking. It must have&nbsp;</p>
<p>been such a load off her mind to feel she knew exactly what she was&nbsp;</p>
<p>going to do. So then we finished going through her stuff and throwing&nbsp;</p>
<p>what she didn't need into the metal drum in the garden and burning it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>the notebook she had used as a diary, and all the letters she had&nbsp;</p>
<p>received. Your letters, too. This seemed a bit strange to me, so I asked&nbsp;</p>
<p>337&nbsp;</p>
<p>her why she was burning stuff like that. I mean, she had always been&nbsp;</p>
<p>so careful about putting your letters away in a safe place and reading&nbsp;</p>
<p>them over and over. She said, "I'm getting rid of everything from the&nbsp;</p>
<p>past so I can be reborn in the future.' I suppose I pretty much took her&nbsp;</p>
<p>at her word. It had its own kind of logic to it, sort of. I remember&nbsp;</p>
<p>thinking how much I wanted her to get healthy and happy. She was so&nbsp;</p>
<p>sweet and lovely that day: I wish you could have seen her!&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When that was over, we went to the dining hall for supper the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>we used to. Then we bathed and I opened a bottle of good wine that I&nbsp;</p>
<p>had been keeping for a special occasion like this and we drank and I&nbsp;</p>
<p>played the guitar. The Beatles, as always, "Norwegian Wood",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Michelle", her favourites. Both of us were feeling pretty good. We&nbsp;</p>
<p>turned out the lights, got undressed and lay in our beds. It was one of&nbsp;</p>
<p>those steaming hot nights. We had the windows wide open, but there&nbsp;</p>
<p>was hardly a breath of wind. It was black as ink outside, the&nbsp;</p>
<p>grasshoppers were screaming, and the smell of the summer grass was&nbsp;</p>
<p>so thick in the room it was hard to breathe. All of a sudden, Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>started talking about you - about the night she had sex with you. In&nbsp;</p>
<p>incredible detail. How you took her clothes off, how you touched her,&nbsp;</p>
<p>how she found herself getting wet, how you went inside her, how&nbsp;</p>
<p>wonderful it felt: she told me all of this in vivid detail. So I asked her:&nbsp;</p>
<p>why are you telling me this now, all of a sudden? I mean, up to then,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had never spoken openly to me about sex. Of course, we had had&nbsp;</p>
<p>some frank sexual talk as a kind of therapy, but she had been too&nbsp;</p>
<p>embarrassed to go into details. Now I couldn't stop her. I was shocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So she says, "I don't know, I just feel like talking about it. I'll stop if&nbsp;</p>
<p>you'd rather not hear it.' "No,' I said, that's OK. "If there's something&nbsp;</p>
<p>you need to talk about, you'd better get it all out. I'll listen to anything&nbsp;</p>
<p>you have to say.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So she went on with her story: "When he went inside me, I couldn't&nbsp;</p>
<p>believe how much it hurt. It was my first time, after all. I was so wet,&nbsp;</p>
<p>he slipped right in, but still, my brain fogged over - it hurt so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>338&nbsp;</p>
<p>He put it in as far as he could, I thought, but then he lifted my legs and&nbsp;</p>
<p>went in even farther. That sent chills all through my body, as if I was&nbsp;</p>
<p>soaking in ice water. My arms and legs went numb, and a wave of&nbsp;</p>
<p>cold went through me. I didn't know what was happening. I thought I&nbsp;</p>
<p>might die right there and then, and I didn't care one way or another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he realized I was in pain, so he stopped moving, and still deep&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside me, he started kissing me all over - my hair, my neck, my&nbsp;</p>
<p>breasts - for a long, long time. Little by little, the warmth returned to&nbsp;</p>
<p>my body, and then, very slowly, he started to move. Oh, Reiko, it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>so wonderful! Now it felt as if my brain was just going to melt away. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to stay like that forever, to stay in his arms for the rest of my&nbsp;</p>
<p>life. That's how great it was.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So I said to her, "If it was so great, why didn't you just stay with&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watanabe and keep doing it every day?' But she said, "No, Reiko, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>knew it would never happen again. I knew this was something that&nbsp;</p>
<p>would come to me once, and leave, and never come back. This would&nbsp;</p>
<p>be a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I had never felt anything like it before,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I've never felt anything like it since. I've never felt that I wanted to&nbsp;</p>
<p>do it again, and I've never grown wet like that again.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Of course, I explained to her that this was something that often&nbsp;</p>
<p>happened to young women and that, in most cases, it cures itself with&nbsp;</p>
<p>age. And, after all, it had worked that one time: there was no need to&nbsp;</p>
<p>worry it wouldn't happen again. I myself had had all kinds of trouble&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I was first married.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But she said, "No, that's not it, Reiko. I'm not worried about that at&nbsp;</p>
<p>all. I just don't want anybody going inside me again. I just don't want&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be violated like that again - by anybody'."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I drank my beer, and Reiko finished her second cigarette. The cat&nbsp;</p>
<p>stretched itself in Reiko's lap, found a new position and went back to&nbsp;</p>
<p>sleep. Reiko seemed at a loss how to go on until she had lit her third&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"After that, Naoko began to sob. I sat on the edge of her bed and&nbsp;</p>
<p>339&nbsp;</p>
<p>stroked her hair. "Don't worry,' I said, "everything is going to be all&nbsp;</p>
<p>right. A beautiful, young girl like you has got to have a man to hold&nbsp;</p>
<p>her and make her happy.' Naoko was drenched in sweat and tears. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>got a bath towel and dried her face and body. Even her panties were&nbsp;</p>
<p>soaked, so I helped her out of&nbsp;</p>
<p>them - now wait a minute, don't get any strange ideas, there was&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing funny going on. We always used to bathe together. She was&nbsp;</p>
<p>like my little sister."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I know, I know," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, Naoko said she wanted me to hold her. I said it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>far too hot for holding, but she said it was the last time we'd be seeing&nbsp;</p>
<p>each other, so I held her. Just for a while. With a bath towel between&nbsp;</p>
<p>us so our sweaty bodies wouldn't stick to each other. And when she&nbsp;</p>
<p>calmed down, I dried her off again, got her nightdress on her and put&nbsp;</p>
<p>her to bed. She fell sound asleep straight away. Or maybe she was just&nbsp;</p>
<p>pretending to sleep. Whatever, she looked so sweet and lovely that&nbsp;</p>
<p>night, she had the face of a girl of 13 or 14 who's never had a bit of&nbsp;</p>
<p>harm done to her since the day she was born. I saw that look on her&nbsp;</p>
<p>face, and I knew I could let myself fall asleep with an easy heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I woke at six in the morning, she was gone. Her nightdress was&nbsp;</p>
<p>there, where she had dropped it, but her clothes and trainers and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>torch I always keep by my pillow were missing. I knew immediately&nbsp;</p>
<p>that something was wrong. I mean, the very fact that she had taken the&nbsp;</p>
<p>torch meant she had left in the dark. I checked her desk just in case,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and&nbsp;</p>
<p>there was the note: Please give all my clothes to Reiko. I woke&nbsp;</p>
<p>up everybody straight away, and we took different paths to look for&nbsp;</p>
<p>her. We searched every inch of the place, from the insides of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>dorms to the surrounding woods. It took us five hours to find her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She'd even brought her own rope."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko sighed and patted the cat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Want some tea?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>340&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes, thanks," said Reiko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I boiled water and brought a pot of tea back to the veranda. Sundown&nbsp;</p>
<p>was approaching. The daylight had grown weak, and long shadows of&nbsp;</p>
<p>trees stretched to our feet. I sipped my tea and looked at the strangely&nbsp;</p>
<p>random garden with its funny mix of yellow globeflowers and pink&nbsp;</p>
<p>azaleas and tall, green nandins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So then the ambulance came and took Naoko away and the police&nbsp;</p>
<p>started questioning me. Not that there was much doubt. There was a&nbsp;</p>
<p>kind of suicide note, and it had obviously been a suicide, and they&nbsp;</p>
<p>took it for granted that suicide was just one of those things that mental&nbsp;</p>
<p>patients did. So it was pretty pro forma. As soon as they left, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>telegraphed you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What a sad little funeral it was," I said. "Her family was obviously&nbsp;</p>
<p>upset that I knew Naoko had died. I'm sure they didn't want people to&nbsp;</p>
<p>know it was suicide. I probably shouldn't even have been there. Which&nbsp;</p>
<p>made me feel even worse. As soon as I got back, I hit the road."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, let's go for a walk. We can shop for something to&nbsp;</p>
<p>make for dinner, maybe. I'm starving."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure. Is there something you want to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sukiyaki," she said. "I haven't had anything like that for years. I used&nbsp;</p>
<p>to dream about sukiyaki - just stuffing myself with beef and green&nbsp;</p>
<p>onions and noodles and roasted tofu and greens."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure, we can have that, but I don't have a sukiyaki pan." "Just leave it&nbsp;</p>
<p>to me. I'll borrow one from your landlord." She ran off to the main&nbsp;</p>
<p>house and came back with a good&nbsp;</p>
<p>sized pan and gas cooker and rubber hose. "Not bad, eh?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not bad!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>We bought all the ingredients at the little shops in the neighbourhood -&nbsp;</p>
<p>beef, eggs, vegetables, tofu. I picked out a fairly decent white wine. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried to pay, but Reiko insisted on paying for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Think how the family would laugh at me if they heard I let my&nbsp;</p>
<p>nephew pay for the food!" said Reiko. "Besides, I'm carrying a fair&nbsp;</p>
<p>341&nbsp;</p>
<p>amount of cash. So don't worry. I wasn't about to leave the sanatorium&nbsp;</p>
<p>broke."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko washed the rice and put it on to boil while I arranged everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>for cooking on the veranda. When everything was ready, Reiko took&nbsp;</p>
<p>out her guitar and appeared to be testing it with a slow Bach fugue. On&nbsp;</p>
<p>the hard parts she would purposely slow down or speed up or make it&nbsp;</p>
<p>detached or sentimental, listening with obvious pleasure to the variety&nbsp;</p>
<p>of sounds she could draw from the instrument. When she played the&nbsp;</p>
<p>guitar, Reiko looked like a 17-year-old girl enjoying the sight of a new&nbsp;</p>
<p>dress. Her eyes sparkled, and she pouted with just the hint of a smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she had finished the piece, she leaned back against a pillar and&nbsp;</p>
<p>looked up at the sky as though deep in thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I talk to you?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Not at all," she said. "I was just thinking how hungry I am."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Aren't you planning to see your husband or your daughter while&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're here? They must be in Tokyo somewhere."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Close enough. Yokohama. But no, I don't plan to see them. I'm sure I&nbsp;</p>
<p>told you before: it's better for them if they don't have anything more to&nbsp;</p>
<p>do with me. They've started a new life. And I'd just feel terrible if I&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw them. No, the best thing is to keep away."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She crumpled up her empty box of Seven Stars cigarettes and took a&nbsp;</p>
<p>new one from her suitcase. She cut the seal and put a cigarette in her&nbsp;</p>
<p>mouth, but she didn't light up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm finished as a human being," she said. "All you're looking at is the&nbsp;</p>
<p>lingering memory of what I used to be. The most important part of&nbsp;</p>
<p>me, what used to be inside, died years ago, and I'm just functioning by&nbsp;</p>
<p>auto-memory."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I like you now, Reiko, the way you are, lingering memory or&nbsp;</p>
<p>whatever. And what I have to say about it may not make any&nbsp;</p>
<p>difference, but I'm really glad that you're wearing Naoko's clothes."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko smiled and lit her cigarette with a lighter. "For such a young&nbsp;</p>
<p>man, you know how to make a woman happy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>342&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt myself reddening. "I'm just saying what I really think." "Sure, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>know," said Reiko, smiling. When the rice was done soon after that, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>oiled the pan and arranged the ingredients for sukiyaki.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me this isn't a dream," said Reiko, sniffing the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, this is 100 per cent realistic sukiyaki," I said. "Empirically&nbsp;</p>
<p>speaking, of course."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of talking, we attacked the sukiyaki with our chopsticks, drank&nbsp;</p>
<p>lots of beer, and finished up with rice. Seagull turned up, attracted by&nbsp;</p>
<p>the smell, so we shared our meat with her. When we had eaten our fill,&nbsp;</p>
<p>we sat leaning against the porch pillars looking at the moon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Satisfied?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Totally," she groaned. "I've never eaten so much in my life."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you want to do now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Have a smoke and go to a public bath. My hair's a mess. I need to&nbsp;</p>
<p>wash it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No problem. There's one down the street."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tell me, Watanabe, if you don't mind. Have you slept with that girl&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You mean have we had sex? Not yet. We decided not to until things&nbsp;</p>
<p>get sorted out."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, now they're sorted out, wouldn't you say?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head. "Now that Naoko's dead, you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, not that. You made your decision long before Naoko died - that&nbsp;</p>
<p>you could never leave Midori. Whether Naoko is alive or dead, it has&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing to do with your decision. You chose Midori. Naoko chose to&nbsp;</p>
<p>die. You're all grown up now, so you have to take responsibility for&nbsp;</p>
<p>your choices. Otherwise, you ruin everything."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But I can't forget her," I said. "I told Naoko I would go on waiting for&nbsp;</p>
<p>her, but I couldn't do it. I turned my back on her in the end. I'm not&nbsp;</p>
<p>saying anyone's to blame: it's a problem for me myself. I do think that&nbsp;</p>
<p>things would have worked out the same way even if I hadn't turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>my back on her. Naoko was choosing death all along. But that's beside&nbsp;</p>
<p>343&nbsp;</p>
<p>the point. I can't forgive myself. You tell me there's nothing I can do&nbsp;</p>
<p>about a natural change in feelings, but my relationship with Naoko&nbsp;</p>
<p>was not that simple. If you stop and think about it, she and I were&nbsp;</p>
<p>bound together at the border between life and death. It was like that&nbsp;</p>
<p>for us from the start."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you feel some kind of pain with regard to Naoko's death, I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>advise you to keep on feeling that pain for the rest of your life. And if&nbsp;</p>
<p>there's something you can learn from it, you should do that, too. But&nbsp;</p>
<p>quite aside from that, you should be happy with Midori. Your pain has&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing to do with your relationship with her. If you hurt her any more&nbsp;</p>
<p>than you already have, the wound could be too deep to fix. So, hard as&nbsp;</p>
<p>it may be, you have to be strong. You have to grow up more, be more&nbsp;</p>
<p>of an adult. I left the sanatorium and came all the way up here to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokyo to tell you that - all the way on that coffin of a train."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I understand what you're telling me," I said to Reiko, "but I'm still not&nbsp;</p>
<p>prepared to follow through on it. I mean, that was such a sad little&nbsp;</p>
<p>funeral! No one should have to die like that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko stretched out her hand and stroked my head. "We all have to die&nbsp;</p>
<p>like that sometime. I will, and so will you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took the five-minute walk along the river bank to the local public&nbsp;</p>
<p>baths and came home feeling more refreshed. I opened the bottle of&nbsp;</p>
<p>wine and we sat on the veranda drinking it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, Watanabe, could you bring out another glass?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sure," I said. "But what for?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're going to have our own funeral for Naoko, just the two of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One that's not so sad."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I handed her the glass, Reiko filled it to the brim and set it on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the stone lantern in the garden. Then she sat on the veranda, leaning&nbsp;</p>
<p>against a pillar, guitar in her arms, and smoked a cigarette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And now could you bring out a box of matches? Make it the biggest&nbsp;</p>
<p>344&nbsp;</p>
<p>one you can find."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I brought out an economy-size box of kitchen matches and sat down&nbsp;</p>
<p>next to her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Now what I want you to do is lay down a match every time I play a&nbsp;</p>
<p>song, just set them in a row. I'm going to play every song I can think&nbsp;</p>
<p>of."&nbsp;</p>
<p>First she played a soft, lovely rendition of Henry Mancini's "Dear&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heart".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You gave a recording of this to Naoko, didn't you?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I did. For Christmas the year before last. She really liked that song."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like it, too," said Reiko. "So sweet and beautiful ..." and she ran&nbsp;</p>
<p>through a few bars of the melody one more time before taking another&nbsp;</p>
<p>sip of wine. "I wonder how many songs I can play before I get&nbsp;</p>
<p>completely drunk. This'll be a nice funeral, don't you think - not so&nbsp;</p>
<p>sad?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko moved on to the Beatles, playing "Norwegian Wood",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yesterday", "Michelle", and "Something". She sang and played&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Here Comes the Sun", then played "The Fool on the Hill". I laid&nbsp;</p>
<p>seven matches in a row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Seven songs," said Reiko, sipping more wine and smoking another&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarette. "Those guys sure knew something about the sadness of life,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and gentleness."&nbsp;</p>
<p>By "those guys" Reiko of course meant John Lennon, Paul McCartney&nbsp;</p>
<p>and George Harrison. After a short breather, Reiko crushed her&nbsp;</p>
<p>cigarette out and picked up her guitar again. She played "Penny Lane",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Blackbird", "Julia", "When I'm 64", "Nowhere Man", "And I Love&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her", and "Hey Jude".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How many songs is that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fourteen," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She sighed and asked me, "How about you? Can you play something -&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe one song?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No way. I'm terrible."&nbsp;</p>
<p>345&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So play it terribly."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I brought out my guitar and stumbled my way through "Up on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roof". Reiko took a rest, smoking and drinking. When I was through,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she applauded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next she played a guitar transcription of Ravel's "Pavanne for a Dying&nbsp;</p>
<p>Queen" and a beautifully clean rendition of Debussy's "Claire de&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lune".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I mastered both of these after Naoko died," said Reiko. "To the end,&nbsp;</p>
<p>her taste in music never rose above the sentimental."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She performed a few Bacharach songs next: "Close to You",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head", "Walk on By", "Wedding Bell&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blues".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Twenty," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm like a human jukebox!" exclaimed Reiko. "My professors would&nbsp;</p>
<p>faint if they could see me now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She went on sipping and puffing and playing: several bossa novas,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rogers and Hart, Gershwin, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Carole King,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder, Kyu Sakamoto's "Sukiyaki Song",&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Blue Velvet", "Green Fields". Sometimes she would close her eyes&nbsp;</p>
<p>and nod or hum to the melody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the wine was gone, we turned to whisky. The wine in the glass&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the garden I poured over the stone lantern and replaced it with&nbsp;</p>
<p>whisky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How's our count going?" Reiko asked. "Forty-eight," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our forty-ninth song Reiko played "Eleanor Rigby", and the&nbsp;</p>
<p>fiftieth was another performance of "Norwegian Wood". After that she&nbsp;</p>
<p>rested her hands and drank some whisky. "Maybe that's enough," she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It is," I answered. "Amazing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko looked me in the eye and said, "Now listen to me, Watanabe. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>want you to forget all about that sad little funeral you saw. Just&nbsp;</p>
<p>346&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember this marvellous one of ours."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Here's one more for good measure," she said, and for her fifty-first&nbsp;</p>
<p>piece she played her favourite Bach fugue. When she was through, she&nbsp;</p>
<p>said in a voice just above a whisper, "How about doing it with me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watanabe?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Strange," I said. "I was thinking the same thing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We went inside and drew the curtains. Then, in the darkened room,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reiko and I sought out each other's bodies as if it were the most&nbsp;</p>
<p>natural thing in the world for us to do. I removed her blouse and&nbsp;</p>
<p>trousers, and then her underwear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've lived a strange life," said Reiko, "but I never thought I'd have my&nbsp;</p>
<p>panties removed for me by a man 19 years my junior."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Would you rather take them off yourself?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No, go ahead. But don't be too shocked at all my wrinkles."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like your wrinkles."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're gonna make me cry," she whispered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kissed her all over, taking special care to follow the wrinkled places&nbsp;</p>
<p>with my tongue. She had the breasts of a little girl. I caressed them&nbsp;</p>
<p>and took her nipples in my teeth, then slid a finger inside her warm,&nbsp;</p>
<p>moist vagina and began to move it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wrong spot, Watanabe," Reiko whispered in my ear. "That's just a&nbsp;</p>
<p>wrinkle."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're telling jokes at a time like this!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said. "I'm scared. I haven't done this for years. I feel like&nbsp;</p>
<p>a 17-year-old girl: I just went to visit a guy in his room, and all of a&nbsp;</p>
<p>sudden I'm naked."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I feel as if I'm violating a 17-year-old girl."&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my finger in her "wrinkle", I moved my lips up her neck to her&nbsp;</p>
<p>ear and took a nipple in my fingers. As her breathing intensified and&nbsp;</p>
<p>her throat began to tremble, I parted her long, slim legs and eased&nbsp;</p>
<p>347&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself inside her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're not going to get me pregnant now, are you? You're taking care&nbsp;</p>
<p>of that, right?" Reiko murmured in my ear. "I'd be so embarrassed if I&nbsp;</p>
<p>got pregnant at this age."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't worry," I said. "Just relax."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was all the way in, she trembled and released a sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caressing her back, I moved inside her and then, without warning, I&nbsp;</p>
<p>came. It was an intense, unstoppable ejaculation. I clutched at her as&nbsp;</p>
<p>my semen pulsed into her warmth again and again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I couldn't stop myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't be silly," Reiko said, giving me a little slap on the rump. "You&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't have to worry about that. Do you always have that on your mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you're doing it with girls?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yeah, pretty much."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, you don't have to think about it with me. Forget it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just let yourself go as much as you like. Did it feel good?" "Fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why I couldn't control myself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is no time for controlling yourself. This is fine. It was&nbsp;</p>
<p>great for me, too."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, Reiko," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What's that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You ought to take a lover again. You're terrific. It's such a waste."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, I'll think about it," she said. "But I wonder if people take lovers&nbsp;</p>
<p>and things in Asahikawa."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growing hard a few minutes later, I went inside her again. Reiko held&nbsp;</p>
<p>her breath and twisted beneath me. I moved slowly and quietly with&nbsp;</p>
<p>my arms around her, and we talked. It felt wonderful to talk that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I said something funny and made her laugh, the tremors came into&nbsp;</p>
<p>me through my penis. We held each other like this for a very long&nbsp;</p>
<p>time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Oh, this feels marvellous!" Reiko said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Moving's not bad either," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>348&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Go ahead. Give it a try."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lifted her hips and went in as far as I could go, then savoured the&nbsp;</p>
<p>sensation of moving in a circular pattern until, having enjoyed it to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>full, I let myself come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Altogether, we joined our bodies four times that night. At the end each&nbsp;</p>
<p>time, Reiko would lie in my arms trembling slightly, eyes closed, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>release a long sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I never have to do this again," said Reiko, "for the rest of my life. Oh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>please, Watanabe, tell me it's true. Tell me I can relax now because&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done enough to last a lifetime."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nobody can tell you that," I said. "There's no way of knowing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to convince Reiko that taking a plane would be faster and&nbsp;</p>
<p>easier, but she insisted on going to Asahikawa by train.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I like the ferry to Hokkaido. And I have no desire to fly through the&nbsp;</p>
<p>air," she said. I accompanied her to Ueno Station. She carried her&nbsp;</p>
<p>guitar and I carried her suitcase. We sat on a platform bench waiting&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the train to pull in. Reiko wore the same tweed jacket and white&nbsp;</p>
<p>trousers she had on when she arrived in Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you really think Asahikawa's not such a bad place?" she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a nice town. I'll visit you there soon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Really?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nodded. "And I'll write to you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I love your letters. Naoko burned all the ones you sent her. And they&nbsp;</p>
<p>were such great letters too!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Letters are just pieces of paper," I said. "Burn them, and what stays in&nbsp;</p>
<p>your heart will stay; keep them, and what&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>vanishes will vanish."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You know, Watanabe,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asahikawa by myself. So be sure to write to me. Whenever I read&nbsp;</p>
<p>your letters, I feel you're right there next to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If that's what you want, I'll write all the time. But don't worry. I know&nbsp;</p>
<p>349&nbsp;</p>
<p>you: you'll do fine wherever you go."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And another thing. I kind of feel like there's something stuck inside&nbsp;</p>
<p>me. Could it be my imagination?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Just a lingering memory," I said and smiled. Reiko smiled, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't forget about me," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I won't forget you," I said. "Ever."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We may never meet again, but no matter where I go, I'll always&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember you and Naoko."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw that she was crying. Before I knew it, I was kissing her. Others&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the platform were staring at us, but I didn't care about such things&nbsp;</p>
<p>any more. We were alive, she and I. And all we had to think about was&nbsp;</p>
<p>continuing to live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Be happy," Reiko said to me as she boarded the train. "I've given you&nbsp;</p>
<p>all the advice I have to give. There's nothing left for me to say. Just be&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy. Take my share and Naoko's and combine them for yourself."&nbsp;</p>
<p>We held hands for a moment, and then we parted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I phoned Midori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have to talk to you," I said. "I have a million things to talk to you&nbsp;</p>
<p>about. A million things we have to talk about. All I want in this world&nbsp;</p>
<p>is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything from the beginning."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midori responded with a long, long silence - the silence of all the&nbsp;</p>
<p>misty rain in the world falling on all the new-mown lawns of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>world. Forehead pressed against the glass, I shut my eyes and waited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last, Midori's quiet voice broke the silence: "Where are you now?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where was I now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gripping the receiver, I raised my head and turned to see what lay&nbsp;</p>
<p>beyond the phone box. Where was I now? I had no idea. No idea at&nbsp;</p>
<p>all. Where was this place? All that flashed into my eyes were the&nbsp;</p>
<p>countless shapes of people walking by to nowhere. Again and again I&nbsp;</p>
<p>called out for Midori from the dead centre of this place that was no&nbsp;</p>
<p>350&nbsp;</p>
<p>place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haruki Murakami was shocked and depressed to find his normal six</p>
<p>figure readership exploding into the millions when he published&nbsp;</p>
<p>Norwegian Wood in 1987. Fame was one thing, superstardom another,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the craziness of it sent him back to the anonymity of Europe (he&nbsp;</p>
<p>had written the book in Greece and Italy). In 1991 he moved to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>United States. Not until 1995 was he prepared to resume living in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Japan, but strictly on his own terms, without the television&nbsp;</p>
<p>appearances and professional pontificating expected of a bestselling&nbsp;</p>
<p>Japanese author.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Norwegian Wood is still the one Murakami book that "everyone" in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Japan has read, but Murakami's young audience has grown up with&nbsp;</p>
<p>him as he has begun wrestling with Japan's dark past (in The Wind-up&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bird Chronicle) and the 1995 double punch of the Kobe earthquake&nbsp;</p>
<p>and, in Underground, the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accustomed to his cool, fragmented, American-flavoured narratives&nbsp;</p>
<p>on mysterious sheep and disappearing elephants, some of Murakami's&nbsp;</p>
<p>early readers were dismayed to find that Norwegian Wood seemed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>be "just" a love story - and one that bore a suspicious resemblance to&nbsp;</p>
<p>the kind of Japanese mainstream autobiographical fiction that&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murakami had rejected since his exciting debut in 1979. As Murakami&nbsp;</p>
<p>himself tells it, "Many of my readers thought that Norwegian Wood&nbsp;</p>
<p>was a retreat for me, a betrayal of what my works had stood for until&nbsp;</p>
<p>then. For me personally, however, it was just the opposite: it was an&nbsp;</p>
<p>adventure, a challenge. I had never written that kind of straight, simple&nbsp;</p>
<p>story, and I wanted to test myself. I set Norwegian Wood in the late&nbsp;</p>
<p>1960s. I borrowed the details of the protagonist's university&nbsp;</p>
<p>environment and daily life from those of my own student days. As a&nbsp;</p>
<p>result, many people think it is an autobiographical novel, but in fact it&nbsp;</p>
<p>352&nbsp;</p>
<p>is not autobiographical at all. My own youth was far less dramatic, far&nbsp;</p>
<p>more boring than his. If I had simply written the literal truth of my&nbsp;</p>
<p>own life, the novel would have been no more than 15 pages long."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author may joke away its autobiographicality, but the book feels&nbsp;</p>
<p>like an autobiography; it favours lived experience over mind games&nbsp;</p>
<p>and shots at the supernatural, and it does indeed tell us much more&nbsp;</p>
<p>straightforwardly than any of his other novels what life was like for&nbsp;</p>
<p>the young Haruki Murakami when he first came to Tokyo from Kobe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, in the years 1968-70 that occupy the bulk of the novel,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murakami's experience centred on meeting the love of his life, his&nbsp;</p>
<p>wife, Yoko, amid the turbulence of the student movement. The author&nbsp;</p>
<p>is right, though: there is a lot of fiction here, and a lot of caricature&nbsp;</p>
<p>and humour, and a lot of symbolism that Murakami's regular readers&nbsp;</p>
<p>will recognise instantly. It is by no means "just" a love story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determined Murakami readers abroad may have succeeded in&nbsp;</p>
<p>obtaining copies of Alfred Birnbaum's earlier translation of&nbsp;</p>
<p>Norwegian Wood, which was produced for distribution in Japan, with&nbsp;</p>
<p>grammar notes at the back, to enable students to enjoy their favourite&nbsp;</p>
<p>author as they struggled with the mysteries of English. Although the&nbsp;</p>
<p>novel has appeared in&nbsp;</p>
<p>French, Italian, Chinese, Korean, Norwegian and Hebrew, the present&nbsp;</p>
<p>edition is the first English translation that Murakami has authorized&nbsp;</p>
<p>for publication outside Japan.&nbsp;</p>
