Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
1<br>
Buffett Lecture at the University of Florida School of Business October 15, 1998 <br>
This speech was the first in a series sponsored by the Graham-Buffett Teaching <br>
Endowment, established in 1997 by a $1 million gift from (1970 UF graduate) Mason <br>
Hawkins. <br>
http://Tinyurl.com/c85or<br>
Introduction:<br>
The Graham-Buffett Course sequence is important to this college because it enables us to <br>
attract students who want this perspective on investing and managing corporations—a<br>
perspective that has been successfully employed by Mr. Buffett, Mr. Hawkins and before <br>
them, Benjamin Graham. <br>
This perspective is quite simple but is sometimes lost in the complexity of our University <br>
analysis. The perspective is that you have to understand the underlying economics of the <br>
businesses that you invest in, work in. You have to be clear-eyed and not be swayed by <br>
the crowd or passing fancies of the moment. And you have to learn and stick to <br>
disciplined principles of business valuation. <br>
In the long run this disciplined approach will more often than not bring success or more <br>
importantly avoid spectacular failures. <br>
Hopefully at the University of Florida we can successfully convey those principles and <br>
create a program for the very best students and in time the very best employers as well. <br>
We thank Mr. Hawkins for his gift ($1 million) and share his thoughts today. <br>
Mason Hawkins: He is someone I have admired tremendously for the last 30 years. In <br>
addition, he is someone each of us could pattern our lives after as a role model. It is my <br>
honor to introduce our lifetime's best long-term investor……<br>
------------- <br>
Buffett: (holds mike) Testing: One million $, two million $….three million $. <br>
I would like to say a few words primarily and then the highlight for me will be getting <br>
your questions. I want to talk about what is on your mind. <br>
Your Future<br>
I would like to talk for just one minute to the students about your future when you leave <br>
here. Because you will learn a tremendous amount about investments, you all have the <br>
ability to do well; you all have the IQ to do well. You all have the energy and initiative to <br>
do well or you wouldn't be here. Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspirations. <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
2<br>
But in determining whether you succeed there is more to it than intellect and energy. I <br>
would like to talk just a second about that. In fact, there was a guy, Pete Kiewit in <br>
Omaha, who used to say, he looked for three things in hiring people: integrity, <br>
intelligence and energy. And he said if the person did not have the first two, the later two <br>
would kill him, because if they don't have integrity, you want them dumb and lazy. <br>
We want to talk about the first two because we know you have the last two. You are all<br>
second-year MBA students, so you have gotten to know your classmates. Think for a <br>
moment that I granted you the right--you can buy 10% of one of your classmate’s<br>
earnings for the rest of their lifetime. You can't pick someone with a rich father; you <br>
have to pick someone who is going to do it on his or her own merit. And I gave you an <br>
hour to think about it. <br>
Will you give them an IQ test and pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it. Will you <br>
pick the one with the best grades? The most energetic? You will start looking for <br>
qualitative factors, in addition to (the quantitative) because everyone has enough brains <br>
and energy. You would probably pick the one you responded the best to, the one who <br>
has the leadership qualities, the one who is able to get other people to carry out their <br>
interests. That would be the person who is generous, honest and who gave credit to other <br>
people for their own ideas. All types of qualities. Whomever you admire the most in the <br>
class. Then I would throw in a hooker. In addition to this person you had to go short one <br>
of your classmates. <br>
That is more fun. Who do I want to go short? You wouldn't pick the person with the <br>
lowest IQ, you would think about the person who turned you off, the person who is <br>
egotistical, who is greedy, who cuts corners, who is slightly dishonest. <br>
As you look at those qualities on the left and right hand side, there is one interesting thing <br>
about them, it is not the ability to throw a football 60 yards, it is not the ability the run the <br>
100 yard dash in 9.3 seconds, it is not being the best looking person in the class, they are <br>
all qualities that if you really want to have the ones on the left hand side, you can have<br>
them. <br>
They are qualities of behavior, temperament, character that are achievable, they are not <br>
forbidden to anybody in this group. And if you look at the qualities on the right hand side <br>
the ones that turn you off in other people, there is not a quality there that you have to <br>
have. You can get rid of it. You can get rid of it a lot easier at your age than at my age, <br>
because most behaviors are habitual. The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they <br>
are too heavy to be broken. There is no question about it. I see people with these selfdestructive behavior patterns at my age or even twenty years younger and they really are <br>
entrapped by them. <br>
They go around and do things that turn off other people right and left. They don't need to <br>
be that way but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it. But at your age <br>
you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior that you wish. It is simply a question <br>
of which you decide. <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
3<br>
If you did this… Ben Graham looked around at the people he admired and Ben Franklin <br>
did this before him. Ben Graham did this in his low teens and he looked around at the <br>
people he admired and he said, &quot;I want to be admired, so why don't I behave like them?&quot; <br>
And he found out that there was nothing impossible about behaving like them. Similarly <br>
he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities. I would <br>
suggest is that if you write those qualities down and think about them a while and make <br>
them habitual, you will be the one you want to buy 10% of when you are all through. <br>
And the beauty of it is that you already own 100% of yourself and you are stuck with it. <br>
So you might as well be that person, that somebody else. <br>
Well that is a short little sermon. So let's get on with what you are interested in. Let's <br>
start with questions……….. <br>
Question: What about Japan? Your thoughts about Japan? <br>
Buffett: My thoughts about Japan? I am not a macro guy. Now I say to myself <br>
Berkshire Hathaway can borrow money in Japan for 10 years at one percent. One <br>
percent! I say gee, I took Graham's class 45 years ago and I have been working hard at <br>
this all my life maybe I can earn more than 1% annually, it doesn't seem impossible. I <br>
wouldn't want to get involved in currency risk, so it would have to be Yen-denominated. I <br>
would have to be in Japanese Real Estate or Japanese companies or something of the sort <br>
and all I have to do is beat one percent. That is all the money is going to cost me and I <br>
can get it for 10 years. So far I haven't found anything. It is kind of interesting. The <br>
Japanese businesses earn very low returns on equity - 4% to 5% - 6% on equity and it is <br>
very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you are in doesn't earn very much <br>
money. <br>
Now some people do it. In fact, I have a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked at Graham<br>
at the same time I did. And it was the first way I went at stocks to buy stocks selling way <br>
below working capital. A very cheap, quantitative approach to stocks. I call it the cigar <br>
butt approach to investing. You walk down the street and you look around for a cigar <br>
butt someplace. Finally you see one and it is soggy and kind of repulsive, but there is one <br>
puff left in it. So you pick it up and the puff is free--it is a cigar butt stock. You get one <br>
free puff on it and then you throw it away and try another one. It is not elegant. But it <br>
works. Those are low return businesses. <br>
But time is the friend of the wonderful business; it is the enemy of the lousy <br>
business. If you are in a lousy business for a long time, you will get a lousy result even if <br>
you buy it cheap. If you are in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you pay a<br>
little bit too much going in you will get a wonderful result if you stay in a long time. <br>
I find very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present. They may change the culture in <br>
some way so that management gets more share holder responsive over there and stock <br>
returns are higher. At the present time you will find a lot of low return businesses and <br>
that was true even when the Japanese economy was booming. It is amazing; they had an <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
4<br>
incredible market without incredible companies. They were incredible in terms of doing <br>
a lot of business, but they were not incredible in terms of the return on equity that they <br>
achieved and that has finally caught up with them. So we have so far done nothing there. <br>
But as long as money is 1% there, we will keep looking. <br>
Question: You were rumored to be one of the rescue buyers of Long Term Capital, <br>
what was the play there, what did you see? <br>
Buffett: The Fortune Magazine that has Rupert Murdoch on the cover. It tells the whole <br>
story of our involvement; it is kind of an interesting story. I got the really serious call <br>
about LTCM on a Friday afternoon that things were getting serious. I know those people <br>
most of them pretty well--most of them at Salomon when I was there. And the place was <br>
imploding and the FED was sending people up that weekend. Between that Friday and <br>
the following Wed. when the NY Fed, in effect, orchestrated a rescue effort but without <br>
any Federal money involved. I was quite active but I was having a terrible time reaching <br>
anybody. <br>
We put in a bid on Wednesday morning. I talked to Bill McDonough at the NY Fed. We <br>
made a bid for 250 million for the net assets but we would have put in 3 and 3/4 billion <br>
on top of that. $3 billion from Berkshire, $700 mil. from AIG and $300 million. from <br>
Goldman Sachs. And we submitted that but we put a very short time limit on that because <br>
when you are bidding on 100 billion worth of securities that are moving around, you <br>
don't want to leave a fixed price bid out there for very long. <br>
In the end the bankers made the deal, but it was an interesting period. The whole LTCM<br>
is really fascinating because if you take Larry Hillenbrand, Eric Rosenfeld, John <br>
Meriwether and the two Nobel prize winners. If you take the 16 of them, they have about <br>
as high an IQ as any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including<br>
Microsoft. An incredible amount of intellect in one room. Now you combine that with <br>
the fact that those people had extensive experience in the field they were operating in. <br>
These were not a bunch of guys who had made their money selling men’s clothing and all <br>
of a sudden went into the securities business. They had in aggregate, the 16, had 300 or <br>
400 years of experience doing exactly what they were doing and then you throw in the <br>
third factor that most of them had most of their very substantial net worth’s in the <br>
businesses. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of their own money up (at risk), super <br>
high intellect and working in a field that they knew. Essentially they went broke. That <br>
to me is absolutely fascinating. <br>
If I ever write a book it will be called, Why Smart People Do Dumb Things. My partner <br>
says it should be autobiographical. But this might be an interesting illustration. They are <br>
perfectly decent guys. I respect them and they helped me out when I had problems at <br>
Salomon. They are not bad people at all. <br>
But to make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and <br>
what they did need. That is just plain foolish; it doesn’t matter what your IQ is. If you <br>
risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you it just <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
5<br>
doesn’t make sense. I don’t care if the odds you succeed are 99 to 1 or 1000 to 1 that you <br>
succeed. If you hand me a gun with a million chambers with one bullet in a chamber and <br>
put it up to your temple and I am paid to pull the trigger, it doesn’t matter how much I <br>
would be paid. I would not pull the trigger. You can name any sum you want, but it <br>
doesn’t do anything for me on the upside and I think the downside is fairly clear. Yet <br>
people do it financially very much without thinking. <br>
There was a lousy book with a great title written by Walter Gutman—You Only Have to <br>
Get Rich Once. Now that seems pretty fundamental. If you have $100 million at the <br>
beginning of the year and you will make 10% if you are unleveraged and 20% if you are <br>
leveraged 99 times out of a 100, what difference if at the end of the year, you have $110 <br>
million or $120 million? It makes no difference. If you die at the end of the year, the <br>
guy who makes up the story may make a typo, he may have said 110 even though you <br>
had a 120. You have gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference. It makes<br>
no difference to your family or anybody else. <br>
The downside, especially if you are managing other people’s money, is not only losing all <br>
your money, but it is disgrace, humiliation and facing friends whose money you have <br>
lost. Yet 16 guys with very high IQs entered into that game. I think it is madness. It is <br>
produced by an over reliance to some extent on things. Those guys would tell me back at <br>
Salomon; a six Sigma event wouldn’t touch us. But they were wrong. History does not<br>
tell you of future things happening. They had a great reliance on mathematics. They <br>
thought that the Beta of the stock told you something about the risk of the stock. It <br>
doesn’t tell you a damn thing about the risk of the stock in my view. <br>
Sigma’s do not tell you about the risk of going broke in my view and maybe now in their <br>
view too. But I don’t like to use them as an example. The same thing in a different way <br>
could happen to any of us, where we really have a blind spot about something that is <br>
crucial, because we know a whole lot of something else. It is like Henry Kauffman said, <br>
“The ones who are going broke in this situation are of two types, the ones who know <br>
nothing and the ones who know everything.” It is sad in a way. <br>
I urge you. We basically never borrow money. I never borrowed money even when I had <br>
$10,000 basically, what difference did it make. I was having fun as I went along it didn’t <br>
matter whether I had $10,000 or $100,000 or $1,000,000 unless I had a medical <br>
emergency come along. <br>
I was going to do the same things when I had a little bit of money as when I had a lot of <br>
money. If you think of the difference between me and you, we wear the same clothes <br>
basically (SunTrust gives me mine), we eat similar food—we all go to McDonald’s or <br>
better yet, Dairy Queen, and we live in a house that is warm in winter and cool in <br>
summer. We watch the Nebraska (football) game on big screen TV. You see it the same <br>
way I see it. We do everything the same—our lives are not that different. The only thing <br>
we do is we travel differently. What can I do that you can’t do? <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
6<br>
I get to work in a job that I love, but I have always worked at a job that I loved. I loved it <br>
just as much when I thought it was a big deal to make $1,000. I urge you to work in jobs <br>
that you love. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like <br>
because you think it will look good on your resume. I was with a fellow at Harvard the <br>
other day who was taking me over to talk. He was 28 and he was telling me all that he <br>
had done in life, which was terrific. And then I said, “What will you do next?” “Well,” <br>
he said, “Maybe after I get my MBA I will go to work for a consulting firm because it <br>
will look good on my resume.” I said, “Look, you are 28 and you have been doing all <br>
these things, you have a resume 10 times than anybody I have ever seen. Isn’t that a little <br>
like saving up sex for your old age? <br>
There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you <br>
love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. When I first got out of Columbia <br>
Business School, I wanted to go to work for Graham immediately for nothing. He <br>
thought I was over-priced. But I kept pestering him. I sold securities for three years and I <br>
kept writing him and finally I went to work for him for a couple of years. It was a great <br>
experience. But I always worked in a job that I loved doing. You really should take a job <br>
that if you were independently wealthy that would be the job you would take. You will<br>
learn something, you will be excited about, and you will jump out of bed. You can’t <br>
miss. You may try something else later on, but you will get way more out of it and I<br>
don’t care what the starting salary is. <br>
When you get out of here take a job you love, not a job you think will look good on your <br>
resume. You ought to find something you like. <br>
If you think you will be happier getting 2x instead of 1x, you are probably making a<br>
mistake. You will get in trouble if you think making 10x or 20x will make you happier <br>
because then you will borrow money when you shouldn’t or cut corners on things. It just <br>
doesn’t make sense and you won’t like it when you look back. <br>
Question: What makes a company something that you like? <br>
Buffett: I like businesses that I can understand. Let’s start with that. That narrows it <br>
down by 90%. There are all types of things I don’t understand, but fortunately, there is <br>
enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there and almost every <br>
company is publicly owned. So you have all American business practically available to <br>
you. So it makes sense to go with things you can understand. <br>
I can understand this, anyone can understand this (Buffett holds up a bottle of CocaCola). Since 1886, it is a simple business, but it is not an easy business—I don’t want an <br>
easy business for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very <br>
valuable castle in the middle and then I want the Duke who is in charge of that castle to <br>
be very honest and hard working and able. Then I want a moat around that castle. The <br>
moat can be various things: The moat around our auto insurance business, Geico, is low <br>
cost. <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
7<br>
People have to buy auto insurance so everyone is going to have one auto insurance policy <br>
per car basically. I can’t sell them 20, but they have to buy one. I can sell them 1. What <br>
are they going to buy it on? (based on what criteria?) They (customers) will buy based <br>
on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is identical among companies or <br>
close enough. So they will do it on cost. So I have to be a low cost producer--that is my <br>
moat. To the extent that my costs are further below the other guy, I have thrown a couple <br>
of sharks into the moat. All the time you have this wonderful castle, there are people out <br>
there who are going to attack it and try to take it away from you. I want a castle I can <br>
understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it. <br>
Kodak<br>
30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca-Cola’s moat. I mean if <br>
you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby and you want to look at that <br>
picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. And you are never going to get a <br>
chance—you are not a professional photographer—so you can evaluate what is going to <br>
look good 20 or 50 years ago. What is in your mind about that photography company <br>
(Share of Mind) is what counts. Because they are promising you that the picture you take <br>
today is going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is very <br>
important to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that. They <br>
had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share of mind. They had <br>
something—that little yellow box—that said Kodak is the best. That is priceless. They <br>
have lost some of that. They haven’t lost it all. <br>
It is not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job, but they let that moat narrow. <br>
They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into <br>
the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the <br>
Olympics. So Fuji gets there and immediately in people’s minds, Fuji becomes more into <br>
parity with Kodak. <br>
You haven’t seen that with Coke; Coke’s moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago. <br>
You can’t see the moat day by day but every time the infrastructure that gets built in <br>
some country that isn’t yet profitable for Coke that will be 20 years from now. The moat <br>
is widening a little bit. Things are, all the time, changing a little in one direction or the <br>
other. Ten years from now, you will see the difference. Our managers of the businesses <br>
we run, I have one message to them, and we want to widen the moat. We want to throw <br>
crocs, sharks and gators—I guess—into the moat to keep away competitors. That comes <br>
about through service, through quality of product, it comes about through cost, some <br>
times through patents, and/or real estate location. So that is the business I am looking <br>
for. <br>
Now what kind of businesses am I going to find like that? Well, I am going to find them <br>
in simple products because I am not going to be able to figure what the moat is going to <br>
look like for Oracle, Lotus or Microsoft, ten years from now. Gates is the best <br>
businessman I have ever run into and they have a hell of a position, but I really don’t <br>
know what that business is going to look like ten years from now. I certainly don’t know <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
8<br>
what his competitors will look like ten years from now. I know what the chewing <br>
business will look like ten years from now. The Internet is not going to change how we <br>
chew gum and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. There will lots <br>
of new products. Is Spearmint or Juicy Fruit going to evaporate? It isn’t going to <br>
happen. You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into the chewing gum business <br>
and try to make a real dent in Wrigley’s. I can’t do it. That is how I think about <br>
businesses. I say to myself, give me a billion dollars and how much can I hurt the guy? <br>
Give me $10 billion dollars and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world? I <br>
can’t do it. Those are good businesses. <br>
Now give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can <br>
figure out how to do it. <br>
So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able <br>
management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be ten (10) years <br>
from now. If I can’t see where they will be ten years from now, I don’t want to buy it. <br>
Basically, I don’t want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five <br>
years, I won’t be happy owning it. I buy a farm and I don’t get a quote on it for five <br>
years and I am happy if the farm does OK. I buy an apartment house and don’t get a <br>
quote on it for five years, I am happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I <br>
expect. People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see <br>
if they are doing well or not doing well. It is crazy. They are buying a piece of the <br>
business. That is what Graham—the most fundamental part of what he taught me. <br>
You are not buying a stock, you are buying part ownership in a business. You will do <br>
well if the business does well, if you didn’t pay a totally silly price. That is what it is all <br>
about. You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you buy farms, you <br>
ought to buy farms you understand. It is not complicated. <br>
Incidentally, by the way, in calling this Graham-Buffett, this is pure Graham. I was very <br>
fortunate. I picked up his book (The Intelligent Investor) when I was nineteen; I got <br>
interested in stocks when I was 6 or 7. I bought my first stock when I was eleven. But I <br>
was playing around with all this stuff—I had charts and volume and I was making all <br>
types of technical calculations and everything. Then I picked up a little book that said <br>
you are not just buying some little ticker symbol, that bounces around every day, you are <br>
buying part of a business. Soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else <br>
followed. It is very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is <br>
no one here who can’t understand Coke………….. (end of first side.) <br>
If I was teaching a class at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the <br>
information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it. Anybody that gave <br>
me an answer, I’d flunk (Laughter). <br>
I don’t know how to do it. But people do it all the time; it is more exciting. If you look <br>
at it like you are going to the races--that is a different thing--but if you are investing…. <br>
Investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more back later at an appropriate rate. <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
9<br>
And to do that you have to understand what you are doing at any time. You have to <br>
understand the business. You can understand some businesses but not all businesses. <br>
Question: You covered half of it which is trying to understand a business and <br>
buying a business. You also alluded to getting a return on the amount of capital <br>
invested in the business. How do you determine what is the proper price to pay for <br>
the business? <br>
Buffett: It is a tough thing to decide but I don’t want to buy into any business I am not <br>
terribly sure of. So if I am terribly sure of it, it probably won’t offer incredible returns. <br>
Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well, offer you 40% a year? We <br>
don’t have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind not losing anything. We bought <br>
See’s Candy in 1972, See’s Candy was then selling 16 m. pounds of candy at a $1.95 a <br>
pound and it was making 2 bits a pound or $4 million pre-tax. We paid $25 million for <br>
it—6.25 x pretax or about 10x after tax. It took no capital to speak of. When we looked <br>
at that business—basically, my partner, Charlie, and I—we needed to decide if there was <br>
some untapped pricing power there. Where that $1.95 box of candy could sell for $2 to <br>
$2.25. If it could sell for $2.25 or another $0.30 per pound that was $4.8 on 16 million <br>
pounds. Which on a $25 million purchase price was fine. We never hired a consultant in <br>
our lives; our idea of consulting was to go out and buy a box of candy and eat it. <br>
What we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There was something <br>
special. Every person in Ca. has something in mind about See’s Candy and <br>
overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentine’s Day to some girl <br>
and she had kissed him. If she slapped him, we would have no business. As long as she <br>
kisses him, that is what we want in their minds. See’s Candy means getting kissed. If we <br>
can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices. I bought it in 1972, and every <br>
year I have raised prices on Dec. 26th, the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot on <br>
Christmas. In fact, we will make $60 million this year. We will make $2 per pound on <br>
30 million pounds. Same business, same formulas, same everything--$60 million bucks <br>
and it still doesn’t take any capital. <br>
And we make more money 10 years from now. But of that $60 million, we make $55 <br>
million in the three weeks before Christmas. And our company song is: “What a friend <br>
we have in Jesus.” (Laughter). It is a good business. Think about it a little. Most <br>
people do not buy boxed chocolate to consume themselves, they buy them as gifts—<br>
somebody’s birthday or more likely it is a holiday. Valentine’s Day is the single biggest <br>
day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far. Women buy for Christmas and <br>
they plan ahead and buy over a two or three week period. Men buy on Valentine’s Day. <br>
They are driving home; we run ads on the Radio. Guilt, guilt, guilt—guys are veering off <br>
the highway right and left. They won’t dare go home without a box of Chocolates by the <br>
time we get through with them on our radio ads. So that Valentine’s Day is the biggest <br>
day. <br>
Can you imagine going home on Valentine’s Day—our See’s Candy is now $11 a pound <br>
thanks to my brilliance. And let’s say there is candy available at $6 a pound. Do you <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
10<br>
really want to walk in on Valentine’s Day and hand—she has all these positive images of <br>
See’s Candy over the years—and say, “Honey, this year I took the low bid.” And hand <br>
her a box of candy. It just isn’t going to work. So in a sense, there is untapped pricing <br>
power—it is not price dependent. <br>
Think of Disney. Disney is selling Home Videos for $16.95 or $18.95 or whatever. All <br>
over the world—people, and we will speak particularly about Mothers in this case, have <br>
something in their mind about Disney. Everyone in this room, when you say Disney, has <br>
something in their mind about Disney. When I say Universal Pictures, if I say 20th<br>
Century Fox, you don’t have anything special in your mind. Now if I say Disney, you <br>
have something special in your mind. That is true around the world. <br>
Now picture yourself with a couple of young kids, whom you want to put away for a <br>
couple of hours every day and get some peace of mind. You know if you get one video, <br>
they will watch it twenty times. So you go to the video store or wherever to buy the <br>
video. Are you going to sit there and premier 10 different videos and watch them each <br>
for an hour and a half to decide which one your kid should watch? No. Let’s say there is <br>
one there for $16.95 and the Disney one for $17.95—you know if you take the Disney<br>
video that you are going to be OK. So you buy it. You don’t have to make a quality <br>
decision on something you don’t want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit <br>
more money if you are Disney and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful<br>
business. It makes it very tough for the other guy. <br>
How would you try to create a brand—Dreamworks is trying—that competes with Disney<br>
around the world and replaces the concept that people have in their minds about Disney<br>
with something that says, Universal Pictures? So a mother is going to walk in and pick <br>
out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney. It is not going to happen. <br>
Coca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. Everyplace – <br>
Disneyland, the World Cup, the Olympics—where people are happy. Happiness and <br>
Coke go together. Now you give me—I don’t care how much money—and tell me that I <br>
am going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people have a <br>
favorable image in their mind about RC Cola. You can’t get it done. You can fool <br>
around, you can do what you want to do. You can have price discounts on weekends. But <br>
you are not going to touch it. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the <br>
moat. You want that moat to widen. <br>
If you are See’s Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the <br>
experience basically of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. It means what is in <br>
the box, it means the person who sells it to you, because all of our business is done when <br>
we are terribly busy. People come in during theose weeks before Chirstmas, Valentine’s <br>
Day and there are long lines. So at five o’clock in the afternoon some woman is selling <br>
someone the last box candy and that person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 <br>
customers. And if the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat has widened and <br>
if she snarls at ‘em, our moat has narrowed. We can’t see it, but it is going on everyday. <br>
But it is the key to it. It is the total part of the product delivery. It is having everything <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
11<br>
associated with it say, See’s Candy and something pleasant happening. That is what <br>
business is all about. <br>
Question: If I have every bought a company where the numbers told me not to. <br>
How much is quantitative and how much is qualitative? <br>
Buffett: The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then <br>
you feel so strongly about the product. And not just the fact you are getting a used cigar <br>
butt cheap. Then it is compelling. I owned a windmill company at one time. Windmills<br>
are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it at a third of working <br>
capital. And we made money out of it, but there is no repetitive money to be made on it. <br>
There is a one-time profit in something like that. And it is just not the thing to be doing. I <br>
went through that phase. I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things. In terms <br>
of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. <br>
Almost every business we have bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis. <br>
We bought two businesses this year. <br>
General Re is a $18 billion deal. I have never been to their home office. I hope it is there. <br>
(Laughter) “There could be a few guys there saying what numbers should we send Buffett<br>
this month?” I could see them going once a month and saying we have $20 billion in the <br>
bank instead of $18 billion. I have never been there. <br>
Before I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, before I bought it, I <br>
had never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years <br>
earlier. And I have seen the service and it seems to develop well. And I got the numbers. <br>
But if you don’t know enough to know about the business instantly, you won’t know <br>
enough in a month or in two months. You have to have sort of the background of <br>
understanding and knowing what you do or don’t understand. That is the key. It is <br>
defining your circle of competence. <br>
Everybody has got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big<br>
the circle is, the important thing is the size of the circle; the important thing is staying <br>
inside the circle. And if that circle only has 30 companies in it out of 1000s on the big <br>
board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you will be OK. And you should know <br>
those businesses well enough so you don’t need to read lots of work. Now I did a lot of <br>
work in the earlier years just getting familiar with businesses and the way I would do that <br>
is use what Phil Fisher would call, the “Scuttlebutt Approach.” I would go out and talk <br>
to customers, suppliers, and maybe ex-employees in some cases. Everybody. Everytime <br>
I was interested in an industry, say it was coal, I would go around and see every coal<br>
company. I would ask every CEO, “If you could only buy stock in one coal company <br>
that was not your own, which one would it be and why? You piece those things together, <br>
you learn about the business after awhile. <br>
Funny, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors. If you had a <br>
silver bullet and you could put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor <br>
and why? You will find who the best guy is in the industry. So there are a lot of things <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
12<br>
you can learn about a business. I have done that in the past on the business I felt I could <br>
understand so I don’t have to do that anymore. The nice thing about investing is that you <br>
don’t have to learn anything new. You can do it if you want to, but if you learn Wrigley’s<br>
chewing gum forty years ago, you still understand Wrigley’s chewing gum. There are not <br>
a lot of great insights to get of the sort as you go along. So you do get a database in your<br>
head. <br>
I had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years; his father-in-law died and <br>
had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company. And he put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he <br>
was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and he mentioned it to this friend, <br>
so my friend said “Why don’t you call Warren?” He called me after the match and in <br>
five minutes I basically had a deal. <br>
But I knew Frank, and I knew the business. I sort of knew the basic economics of the <br>
shoe business, so I could buy it. Quantitatively, I have to decide what the price is. But, <br>
you know, that is either yes or no. I don’t fool a lot around with negotiations. If they <br>
name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they don’t, I was happy the day before, <br>
so I will be happy the day after without owning it. <br>
Question: The Asian Crisis and how it affects a company like Coke that recently <br>
announced their earnings would be lower in the fourth quarter. <br>
Buffett: Well, basically I love it, but because the market for Coca-Cola products will <br>
grow far faster over the next twenty years internationally than it will in the United States. <br>
It will grow in the U.S. on a per capita basis. The fact that it will be a tough period for <br>
who knows—three months or three years—but it won’t be tough for twenty years. People <br>
will still be going to be working productively around the world and they are going to find <br>
this is a bargain product in terms of a portion of their working day that they have to give <br>
up in order to have one of these, better yet, five of them a day like I do. <br>
This is a product that in 1936 when I first bought 6 of those for a quarter and sold them <br>
for a nickel each. It was in a 6.5 oz bottle and you paid a two cents deposit on the bottle. <br>
That was a 6.5 oz. bottle for a nickel at that time; it is now a 12 oz. can which if you buy <br>
it on Weekends or if you buy it in bigger quantities, so much money doesn’t go to <br>
packaging—you essentially can buy the 12 ozs. for not much more than 20 cents. So you <br>
are paying not much more than twice the per oz. price of 1936. This is a product that has <br>
gotten cheaper and cheaper relative to people’s earning power over the years. And which <br>
people love. And in 200 countries, you have the per capita consumption use going up <br>
every year for a product that is over 100 years old that dominates the market. That is <br>
unbelievable. <br>
One thing that people don’t understand is one thing that makes this product worth 10s <br>
and 10s of billions of dollars is one simple fact about really all colas, but we will call it <br>
Coca-Cola for the moment. It happens to be a name that I like. Cola has no taste <br>
memory. You can drink one of these at 9 O’clock, 10 O’clock, 1 O’clock and 5 O’clock. <br>
The one at 5 o’clock will taste as good to you as the one you drank early in the morning, <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
13<br>
you can’t do that with Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange, Grape. All of those things <br>
accumulate on you. Most foods and beverages accumulate; you get sick of them after a <br>
while. And if you eat See’s Candy—we get these people who go to work for us at See’s <br>
Candy and the first day they go crazy, but after a week they are eating the same amount <br>
as if they were buying it, because chocolate accumulates on you. There is no taste <br>
memory to Cola and that means you get people around the world who will be heavy <br>
users—who will drink five a day, or for Diet Coke, 7 or even 8 a day. They will never do <br>
that with other products. So you get this incredible per capita consumption. The average <br>
person in this part of the world or maybe a little north of here drinks 64 ozs. of liquid a <br>
day. You can have 64 ozs. of that be Coke and you will not get fed up with Coke if you <br>
like it to start with in the least. But if you do that with anything else; if you eat just one <br>
product all day, you will get a little sick of it after a while. <br>
It is a huge factor. So today over 1 billion of Coca-Cola product servings will be sold in <br>
the world and that will grow year by year. It will grow in every country virtually, and it <br>
will grow on a per capita basis. And twenty years from now it will grow a lot faster <br>
internationally than in the U.S., so I really like that market better, because there is more <br>
growth there over time. But it will hurt them in the short term right now, but that doesn’t <br>
mean anything. Coca-Cola went public in 1919; the stock sold for $40 per share. The <br>
Chandler family bought the whole business for $2,000 back in the late 1880s. So now he <br>
goes public in 1919, $40 per share. One year later it is selling for $19 per share. It has <br>
gone down 50% in one year. You might think it is some kind of disaster and you might <br>
think sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious. And a whole bunch of <br>
things. You can always find reasons that weren't the ideal moment to buy it. Years later <br>
you would have seen the Great Depression, WW II and sugar rationing and <br>
thermonuclear weapons and the whole thing—there is always a reason. <br>
But in the end if you had bought one share at $40 per share and reinvested the dividends, <br>
it would be worth $5 million now ($40 compounding at 14.63% for 86 years!). That <br>
factor so overrides anything else. If you are right about the business you will make a lot <br>
of money. The timing part of it is very tricky thing so I don’t worry about any given <br>
event if I got a wonderful business what it does next year or something of the sort. Price <br>
controls have been in this country at various times and that has fouled up even the best of <br>
businesses. I wouldn’t be able to raise prices Dec 31st on See’s Candy. But that doesn’t <br>
make it a lousy business if that happens to happen, because you are not going to have <br>
price controls forever. We had price controls in the early 70s. <br>
The wonderful business—you can figure what will happen, you can’t figure out when it <br>
will happen. You don’t want to focus too much on when but you want to focus on what. <br>
If you are right about what, you don’t have to worry about when very much. <br>
Question: What about your business mistakes? <br>
Buffett: How much time do you have? The interesting thing about investments for me <br>
and my partner, Charlie Munger, the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of <br>
commission, but of omission. They are where we knew enough about the business to do <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
14<br>
something and where, for one reason or another, sat they're sucking out thumbs instead of <br>
doing something. And so we have passed up things where we could have made billions <br>
and billions of dollars from things we understood, forget about things we don’t <br>
understand. The fact I could have made billions of dollars from Microsoft doesn’t mean <br>
anything because I never could understand Microsoft. But if I can make billions out of <br>
healthcare stocks, then I should make it. And I didn’t when the Clinton health care <br>
program was proposed and they all went in the tank. We should have made a ton of <br>
money out of that because I could understand it. And didn’t make it. <br>
I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back the mid-1980s, but I didn’t <br>
do it. Those are billion dollar mistakes or multi-billion dollar mistakes that generally <br>
accepted accounting principles don’t pick up. The mistakes you see. I made a mistake <br>
when I bought US Air Preferred some years ago. I had a lot of money around. I make <br>
mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead. Don’t hang around the <br>
office. But I hang around the office and I have money in my pocket, I do something <br>
dumb. It happens every time. So I bought this thing. Nobody made me buy it. I now <br>
have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline. I say, “I<br>
am Warren and I am an air-aholic.” They try to talk me down, “Keep talking don’t do <br>
anything rash.” Finally I got over it. But I bought it. And it looked like we would lose <br>
all our money in it. And we came very close to losing all our money in it. You can say <br>
we deserved to lose our money it. <br>
We bought it because it was an attractive security. But it was not in an attractive <br>
industry. I did the same thing in Salomon. I bought an attractive security in a business I <br>
wouldn’t have bought the equity in. So you could say that is one form of mistake. <br>
Buying something because you like the terms, but you don’t like the business that well. I <br>
have done that in the past and will probably do that again. The bigger mistakes are the <br>
ones of omission. Back when I had $10,000 I put $2,000 of it into a Sinclair Service <br>
Station which I lost, so the opportunity cost on that money is about $6 billion right now-- <br>
fairly big mistakes. It makes me feel good when my Berkshire goes down, because the <br>
cost of my Sinclair Station goes down too. My 20% opportunity cost. I will say this, it is <br>
better to learn from other people’s mistakes as much as possible. But we don’t spend any <br>
time looking back at Berkshire. I have a partner, Charlie Munger; we have been pals for <br>
forty years—never had an argument. We disagree on things a lot but we don’t have <br>
arguments about it. <br>
We never look back. We just figure there is so much to look forward to that there is no <br>
sense thinking of what we might have done. It just doesn’t make any difference. You can <br>
only live life forward. You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big <br>
thing to do is to stick with the businesses you understand. So if there is a generic <br>
mistake outside your circle of competence like buying something that somebody tips you <br>
on or something of the sort. In an area you know nothing about, you should learn <br>
something from that which is to stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really <br>
want your decision making to be by looking in the mirror. Saying to yourself, “I am<br>
buying 100 shares of General Motors at $55 because……..” It is your responsibility if <br>
you are buying it. There’s gotta be a reason and if you can’t state the reason, you <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
15<br>
shouldn’t buy it. If it is because someone told you about it at a cocktail party, not good <br>
enough. It can’t be because of the volume or a reason like the chart looks good. It has to <br>
be a reason to buy the business. That we stick to pretty carefully. That is one of the<br>
things Ben Graham taught me. <br>
Question: The current tenuous economic situation and interest rates? Where are we <br>
going? <br>
Buffett: I don’t think about the macro stuff. What you really want to in investments is <br>
figure out what is important and knowable. If it is unimportant and unknowable, you <br>
forget about it. What you talk about is important but, in my view, it is not knowable. <br>
Understanding Coca-Cola is knowable or Wrigley’s or Eastman Kodak. You can <br>
understand those businesses that are knowable. Whether it turns out to be important <br>
depends where your valuation leads you and the firm’s price and all that. But we have<br>
never not bought or bought a business because of any Macro feeling of any kind because <br>
it doesn’t make any difference. Let’s say in 1972 when we bought See’s Candy, I think <br>
Nixon put on the price controls a little bit later, but so what! We would have missed a <br>
chance to buy something for $25 million that is producing $60 million pre-tax now. We <br>
don’t want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some prediction <br>
about something we are no good on anyway. So we don’t read or listen to in relation to <br>
macro factors at all. The typical investment counselor organization goes out and they <br>
bring out their economist and they trot him out and he gives you this big macro picture. <br>
And they start working from there on down. In our view that is nonsense. <br>
If Alan Greenspan was on the one side of me and Robert Rubin on the other side and they <br>
both were whispering in my ear exactly what they were going to do the next twelve <br>
months, it wouldn’t make any difference to me what I would pay for Executive Jet or<br>
General Re or anything else I do. <br>
Question: What is the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being on <br>
Wall Street? <br>
Buffett: I worked on Wall Street for a couple of years and I have my best friends on both <br>
coasts. I like seeing them. I get ideas when I go there. But the best way to think about <br>
investments is to be in a room with no one else and just think. And if that doesn’t <br>
work, nothing else is going to work. The disadvantage of being in any type of market <br>
environment like Wall Street in the extreme is that you get over-stimulated. You think <br>
you have to do something every day. The Chandler family paid $2,000 for this company <br>
(Coke). You don’t have to do much else if you pick one of those. And the trick then is <br>
not to do anything else. Even not to sell at 1919, which the family did later on. So what <br>
you are looking for is some way to get one good idea a year. And then ride it to its full <br>
potential and that is very hard to do in an environment where people are shouting prices <br>
back and forth every five minutes and shoving reports in front of your nose and all that. <br>
Wall Street makes its money on activity. You make your money on inactivity.<br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
16<br>
If everyone in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person, <br>
you will all end up broke. And the intermediary will end up with all the money. If you all <br>
own stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you <br>
will end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. He is like the <br>
Doctor who gets paid on how often to get you to change pills. If he gave you one pill that<br>
cures you the rest of your life, he would make one sale, one transaction and that is it. But <br>
if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it will be <br>
great for him and the prescriptionists. You won’t be any healthier and you will be a lot <br>
worse off financially. You want to stay away from any environment that stimulates <br>
activity. And Wall Street would have the effective of doing that. <br>
When I went back to Omaha, I would go back with a whole list of companies I wanted to <br>
check out and I would get my money’s worth out of those trips, but then I would go back <br>
to Omaha and think about it. <br>
Question: How to evaluate Berkshire or MSFT if it does not pay dividends? <br>
Buffett: It won’t pay any dividends either. That is a promise I can keep. All you get <br>
with Berkshire, you stick it in your safe deposit box and then every year you go down and <br>
fondle it. You take it out and then you put it back. There is enormous psychic reward in <br>
that. Don’t underestimate it. <br>
The real question is if we can retain dollar bills and turn them into more than a dollar at a <br>
decent rate. That is what we try to do. And Charlie Munger and I have all our money in <br>
it to do that. That is all we will get paid for doing. We won’t take any options or we <br>
won’t take any salaries to speak of. But that is what we are trying to do. It gets harder all <br>
the time. The more money we manage the harder it is to do that. We would do way <br>
better percentage wise with Berkshire if it was 1/100th the present size. It is run for its <br>
owners, but it isn’t run to give them dividends because so far every dollar that we earned <br>
or could have paid out, we have turned into more than a dollar. It is worth more than a <br>
dollar to keep it. Therefore, it would be silly to pay it out. Even if everyone was taxfree that owned it. It would have been a mistake to pay dividends at Berkshire. Because <br>
so far the dollar bills retained have turned into more than a dollar. But there is no <br>
guarantee that happens in the future. At some point the game runs out on that. That is <br>
what the business is about. Nothing else about the business do we judge ourselves by. <br>
We don’t judge it by the size of its home office building or anything the like the number <br>
of people working there. We have 12 people working at headquarters and 45,000 <br>
employees at Berkshire, 12 people at HQ and 3,500 sq ft. and we won’t change it. <br>
But we will judge ourselves by the performance of the company and that is the only way <br>
we will get paid. But believe me, it is a lot harder than it used to be. <br>
Question: What tells you when an investment has reached its full potential? <br>
Buffett: I don’t buy Coke with the idea it will be out of gas in 10 years or 50 years. There <br>
could be something that happens by I think the chances are almost nil. So what we <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
17<br>
really want to do is buy businesses that we would be happy to own forever. It is the same <br>
way I fell about people who buy Berkshire. I want people who buy Berkshire to plan to <br>
hold it forever. They may not for one reason or the other but I want them at the time they <br>
buy it to think they are buying a business they are going to want to own forever. <br>
And I don’t say that is the only way to buy things. It is just the group to join me because <br>
I don’t want to have a changing group all the time. I measure Berkshire by how little <br>
activity there is in it. If I had a church and I was the preacher and half the congregation <br>
left every Sunday. I wouldn’t say, “It is marvelous to have all this liquidity among my <br>
members.” <br>
Terrific turnover… I would rather go to church where all the seats are filled every <br>
Sunday by the same people. Well that is the way we look at the businesses we buy. We <br>
want to buy something virtually forever. And we can’t find a lot of those. And back <br>
when I started, I had way more ideas than money so I was just constantly having to sell <br>
what was the least attractive stock in order to buy something I just discovered that looked <br>
even cheaper. But that is not our problem really now. So we hope we are buying <br>
businesses that we are just as happy holding five years from now as now. And if we ever <br>
found a huge acquisition, then maybe we would have to sell something. Maybe to make <br>
that acquisition but that would be a very pleasant problem to have. <br>
We never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30 <br>
saying if it goes to 40 we’ll sell it or 50 or 60 or 100. We just don’t do it that way. <br>
Anymore than when we buy a private business like See’s Candy for $25 million. We <br>
don’t ever say if we ever get an offer of $50 million for this business we will sell it. That <br>
is not the way to look at a business. <br>
The way to look at a business is this going to keep producing more and more money over <br>
time? And if the answer to that is yes, you don’t need to ask any more questions. <br>
Questions: How did you decide to invest in Salomon? <br>
Buffett: Salomon like I said, I went into that because it was a 9% security in 1987 in <br>
September 1987 and the Dow was up 35% and we sold a lot of stuff. And I had a lot of <br>
money around and it looked to me like we would never get to do anything, so I took an <br>
attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of. I went in <br>
because of that and I think generally it is a mistake. It worked out OK finally on that. But <br>
it is not what I should have been doing. I either should have waited in which case I could <br>
have bought more Coca-Cola a year later or thereabouts or I should have even bought <br>
Coke at the prices it was selling at even though it was selling at a pretty good price at the <br>
time. So that was a mistake. <br>
On Long-Term Capital that is—we have owned other businesses associated with <br>
securities over the years-–One of them is arbitrage. I’ve done arbitrage for 45 years and <br>
Graham did it for 30 years before that. That is a business unfortunately I have to be near <br>
a phone for. I have to really run it (arbitrage operations) out of the office myself, because <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
18<br>
it requires being more market-attuned because I don’t want to do that anymore. So unless <br>
a really big arbitrage situation came along that I understood, I won’t be doing much of <br>
that. But I’ve probably participated in about 300 arbitrage situations at least in my life <br>
maybe more. It was a good business, a perfectly good business. <br>
LTCM has a bunch of positions, they have tons of positions, but the top ten are probably <br>
90% of the money that is at risk, and I know something about those ten positions. I don’t <br>
know everything about them by a long shot, but I know enough that I would feel OK at a <br>
big discount going in and we had the staying power to hold it out. We might lose money <br>
on something on that, but the odds are with us. That is a game that I understand. There <br>
are few other positions we have that are not that big because they can’t get that big. But <br>
they could involve yield curve relationships or on the run/off the run governments that <br>
are just things you learn over time being around securities markets. They are not the base <br>
of our business. Probably on average, they have accounted for ½ - ¾ a percentage point <br>
of our return a year. They are little pluses you get for actually having been around a long <br>
time. <br>
Arbitrage<br>
One of the first arbitrages I did involved a company that offered cocoa beans in exchange <br>
for their stock. That was in 1955. I bought the stock, turned in the stock, got warehouse <br>
certificates for cocoa beans and they happen to be a different type but there was a basis <br>
differential and I sold them. That was something I was around at the time, so I learned <br>
about it. There hasn’t been a cocoa deal since. 40 odd years, I have been waiting for a <br>
cocoa deal. I haven’t seen it. It is there in my memory if it ever comes along. LTCM is <br>
that on a big scale. <br>
Question: Diversification? <br>
Buffett: The question is about diversification. I have a dual answer to that. If you are not <br>
a professional investor. If your goal is not to manage money to earn a significantly better <br>
return than the world, then I believe in extreme diversification. I believe 98% - 99% who <br>
invest should extensively diversify and not trade, so that leads them to an index fund type <br>
of decision with very low costs. All they are going to do is own part of America. And <br>
they have made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile. I don’t quarrel <br>
with that at all. That is the way they should approach it unless they want to bring an <br>
intensity to the game to make a decision and start evaluating businesses. Once you are in <br>
the businesses of evaluating businesses and you decide that you are going to bring the <br>
effort and intensity and time involved to get that job done, then I think diversification is a <br>
terrible mistake to any degree. I got asked that question the other day at SunTrust. If you <br>
really know businesses, you probably shouldn’t own more than six of them. <br>
If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And <br>
you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead <br>
of putting more money into your first one is gotta be a terrible mistake. Very few people <br>
have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
19<br>
best idea. So I would say for anyone working with normal capital who really knows the <br>
businesses they have gone into, six is plenty, and I probably have half of what I like best. <br>
I don’t diversify personally. All the people I’ve known that have done well with the <br>
exception of Walter Schloss, Walter diversifies a lot. I call him Noah, he has two of <br>
everything. <br>
Question: How do you distinguish the Cokes of the world from the Proctor &amp; <br>
Gambles of this world? <br>
Buffett: Well, P&amp;G is a very, very good business with strong distribution capability and <br>
lots of brand names, but if you ask me and I am going to go away for twenty years and <br>
put all my family’s net worth into one business, would I rather have P&amp;G or Coke? <br>
Actually P&amp;G is more diversified among product line, but I would feel more sure of <br>
Coke than P&amp;G. I wouldn’t be unhappy if someone told me I had to own P&amp;G during <br>
the twenty-year period. I mean that would be in my top 5 percent. Because they are not <br>
going to get killed, but I would feel better about the unit growth and pricing power of a <br>
Coke over twenty or thirty years. <br>
Right now the pricing power might be tough, but you think a billion servings a day for a<br>
penny each or $10 million per day. We own 8% of that, so that is $800,000 per day for <br>
Berkshire Hathaway. You could get another penny out of the stuff. It doesn’t seem <br>
impossible. I think it is worth a penny more. Right now it would be a mistake to try and <br>
get it in most markets. But over time, Coke will make more per serving than it does now. <br>
Twenty years from now I guarantee they will make more per serving, and they will be <br>
selling a whole lot more servings. I don't know how many or how much more, but I <br>
know that. <br>
P&amp;G's main products--I don't think they have the kind of dominance, and they don't have <br>
the kind of unit growth, but they are good businesses. I would not be unhappy if you told <br>
me that I had to put my family's net worth into P&amp;G and that was the only stock I would <br>
own. I might prefer some other name, but there are not 100 other names I would prefer. <br>
Question: Would you buy McDonald’s and go away for twenty years? <br>
Buffett: McDonald’s has a lot of things going for it, particularly abroad again. Thee <br>
position abroad in many countries is stronger than it is here. It is a tougher business over <br>
time. People don't want to be eating--exception to the kids when they are giving away<br>
beanie babies or something--at McDonald’s every day. If people drink five Cokes a day, <br>
they probably will drink five of them tomorrow. The fast food business is tougher than <br>
that but if you had to pick one hand to have in the fast food business, which is going to be <br>
a huge business worldwide, you would pick McDonald’s. I mean it has the strongest <br>
position. <br>
It doesn't win taste test with adults. It does very well with children and it does fine with <br>
adults, but it is not like it is a clear winner. And it is gotten into the game in recent years <br>
of being more price promotional--you remember the experiment a year ago or so. It has <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
20<br>
gotten more dependent on that rather than selling the product by itself. I like the product <br>
by itself. I feel better about Gillette if people buy the Mach 3 because they like the Mach <br>
3 than if they get a Beanie Baby with it. So I think fundamentally it is a stronger product <br>
if that is the case. And that is probably the case. <br>
We own a lot of Gillette and you can sleep pretty well at night if you think of a couple <br>
billion men with their hair growing on their faces. It is growing all night while you sleep. <br>
Women have two legs, it is even better. So it beats counting sheep. And those are the <br>
kinds of business…(you look for). But what type of promotion am I going to put out <br>
there against Burger King next month or what if they sign up Disney and I don't get <br>
Disney? I like the products that stand alone absent price promotion or appeals although <br>
you can build a very good business based on that. And McDonald’s is a terrific business. <br>
It is not as good a business as Coke. There really hardly are any. It is a very good <br>
business and if you bet on one company in that field bet on (garbled) McDonald’s. We <br>
bought Dairy Queen a while back that is why I am plugging it shamelessly here. <br>
Question: What do I think about the utility industry? <br>
Buffett: I have thought about that a lot because you can put big money in it. I have even <br>
thought of buying the entire businesses. There is a fellow in Omaha actually that has done <br>
a little of that through Cal Energy. But I don't quite understand the game in terms of how <br>
it is going to develop with deregulation. I can see how it destroys a lot of value through <br>
the high cost producer once they are not protected by a monopoly territory. <br>
I don't for sure see who benefits and how much. Obviously the guy with very low cost <br>
power or some guy has hydro-power at two cents a KwH has a huge advantage. But how <br>
much of that he gets to keep or how extensively he can send that outside his natural <br>
territory, I haven't been able to figure that out so I really know what the Industry will <br>
look like in ten years. But it is something I think about and if I ever develop any insights <br>
that call for action, I will act on them. Because I think I can understand the attractiveness <br>
of the product. All the aspects of certainty of users need and the fact it is a bargain and <br>
all of that. I understand. I don't understand who is going to make the money in ten years. <br>
And that keeps me away. <br>
Question: Why do large caps outperform small caps (1998)? <br>
Buffett: We don't care if a company is large cap, small cap, middle cap, micro cap. It <br>
doesn't make any difference. The only questions that matter to us: <br>
• Do we understand the business? <br>
• Do we like the people running it? <br>
• And does it sell for a price that is attractive? <br>
From my personal standpoint running Berkshire now because we got, pro forma for Gen. <br>
Re, $75 to $80 billion to invest in and I only want to invest in five things, so I am really <br>
limited to very big companies. But if I were investing $100,000, I wouldn't care whether <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
21<br>
something was large cap or small cap or anything. I would just look for businesses I <br>
understood. <br>
Now, I think, on balance, large cap companies as businesses have done extraordinarily<br>
well the last ten years--way better than people anticipated they would do. You really <br>
have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. And that is <br>
something nobody dreamed of and that is being produced by very large companies in <br>
aggregate. So you have had this huge revaluation upwards because of lower interest rates <br>
and much higher returns on capital. If America business is really a disguised bond that <br>
earns 20%, a 20% coupon it is much better than a bond with a 13% coupon. And that has <br>
happened with big companies in recent years, whether it is permanent or not is another <br>
question. I am skeptical of that. I wouldn't even think about it--except for questions of <br>
how much money we run--I wouldn't even think about the size of the business. See's <br>
Candy was a $25 million business when we bought it. If I can find one now, as big as we <br>
are, I would love to buy it. It is the certainty of it that counts. <br>
Question: The securitization of real estate? <br>
Buffett: There has been enormous securitization of the debt too of real estate and that is <br>
one of the items right now that is really clogging up the capital markets. The mortgage <br>
back securities are just not moving, commercial, not residential mortgage backs. But I <br>
think you are directing your question at equities probably. The equities, if you leave out <br>
the corporate form, have been a lousy way to own equities. You have interjected a <br>
corporate income tax into something that people individually have been able to own with <br>
a single tax, and to have the normal corporate form you have a double taxation in there. <br>
You really don't need it and it takes too much of the return. <br>
REITS have, in effect, created a conduit so you don't get the double taxation, but they <br>
also generally have fairly high operating expenses. If you get real estate, let's just say <br>
you can buy fairly simple types of real estate at an 8% yield, or thereabouts, and you take <br>
away close to 1% to 1.5% by the time you count stock options and everything, it is not a <br>
terribly attractive way to own real estate. Maybe the only way a guy with a $1,000 or <br>
$5,000 can own it but if you have $1 million or $10 million, you are better off owning the <br>
real estate properties yourself instead of sticking some intermediary in between who will <br>
get a sizable piece of the return for himself. So we have found very little in that field. <br>
You will see an announcement in the next couple of weeks that may belie what I am <br>
telling you today. I don't want you to think I am double crossing you up here. But <br>
generally speaking we have seen very little in that field that gets us excited. People <br>
sometimes get very confused about--they will look at some huge land company, like <br>
Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around over 100 years and has got a couple of <br>
million acres in Texas. And they will sell 1% of their land every year and they will take <br>
that (as income? Garbled) and come up with some huge value compared to the market <br>
value. But that is nonsense if you really own the property. You can't move. You can't <br>
move 50% of the properties or 20% of the properties, it is way worse than an illiquid <br>
stock. So you get these, I think, you get some very silly valuations placed on a lot of real <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
22<br>
estate companies by people who really don't understand what it is like to own one and try<br>
to move large quantity of properties. <br>
REITS have behaved horribly in this market as you know and it is not at all inconceivable<br>
that they become a class that would get so unpopular that they would sell at significant <br>
discounts from what you could sell the properties for. And they could get interesting as a <br>
class and then the question is whether management would fight you in that process <br>
because they would be giving up their income stream for managing things and their <br>
interests might run counter to the shareholders on that. I have always wondered about <br>
REITS that have managements they say their assets are so wonderful, and they are so <br>
cheap and then they (management) go out and sell stock. There is a contradiction in that. <br>
They say our stock is very cheap at $28 and then they sell a lot of stock at $28 less an <br>
underwriting commission. There is a disconnect there. But it is a field we look at. <br>
Charlie and I can understand real estate, and we would be open for very big transactions <br>
periodically. If there was a LTCM situation translated to real estate, we would be open to <br>
that, the trouble is so many other people would be too that it would unlikely go at a price <br>
that would get us really get us excited. <br>
Question: A down market is good for you? <br>
Buffett: I have no idea were the market is going to go. I prefer it going down. But my <br>
preferences have nothing to do with it. The market knows nothing about my feelings. <br>
That is one of the first things you have to learn about a stock. You buy 100 shares of <br>
General Motors (GM). Now all of a sudden you have this feeling about GM. It goes <br>
down, you may be mad at it. You may say, &quot;Well, if it just goes up for what I paid for it, <br>
my life will be wonderful again.&quot; Or if it goes up, you may say how smart you were and <br>
how you and GM have this love affair. You have got all these feelings. The stock doesn't <br>
know you own it. <br>
The stock just sits there; it doesn't care what you paid or the fact that you own it. Any <br>
feeling I have about the market is not reciprocated. I mean it is the ultimate cold shoulder <br>
we are talking about here. Practically anybody in this room is probably more likely to be <br>
a net buyer of stocks over the next ten years than they are a net seller, so everyone of you <br>
should prefer lower prices. If you are a net eater of hamburger over the next ten years, <br>
you want hamburger to go down unless you are a cattle producer. If you are going to be a <br>
buyer of Coca-Cola and you don't own Coke stock, you hope the price of Coke goes <br>
down. You are looking for it to be on sale this weekend at your Supermarket. You want <br>
it to be down on the weekends not up on the weekends when you tend the Supermarket. <br>
The NYSE is one big supermarket of companies. And you are going to be buying stocks, <br>
what you want to have happen? You want to have those stocks go down, way down; you <br>
will make better buys then. Later on twenty or thirty years from now when you are in a <br>
period when you are dis-saving, or when your heirs dis-save for you, then you may care <br>
about higher prices. There is Chapter 8 in Graham's Intelligent Investor about the <br>
attitude toward stock market fluctuations, that and Chapter 20 on the Margin of Safety <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
23<br>
are the two most important essays ever written on investing as far as I am concerned. <br>
Because when I read Chapter 8 when I was 19, I figured out what I just said but it is <br>
obvious, but I didn't figure it out myself. It was explained to me. I probably would have <br>
gone another 100 years and still thought it was good when my stocks were going up. We <br>
want things to go down, but I have no idea what the stock market is going to do. I never <br>
do and I never will. It is not something I think about at all. <br>
When it goes down, I look harder at what I might buy that day because I know there is <br>
more likely to be some merchandise there to use my money effectively in. <br>
Moderator: Ok, Warren, we will let you take one more question from the <br>
audience…. <br>
Buffett: I will let you pick who get it. You can be the guy…(laughter). <br>
Question: What would you do to live a happier life if you could live over again? <br>
Buffett: This will sound disgusting. The question is how would I live my life over again <br>
to live a happier life? The only thing would be to select a gene pool where people lived <br>
to 120 or something where I came from. <br>
I have been extraordinarily lucky. I mean, I use this example and I will take a minute or <br>
two because I think it is worth thinking about a little bit. Let's just assume it was 24 <br>
hours before you were born and a genie came to you and he said, &quot;Herb, you look very <br>
promising and I have a big problem. I got to design the world in which you are going to <br>
live in. I have decided it is too tough; you design it. So you have twenty-four hours, you <br>
figure out what the social rules should be, the economic rules and the governmental rules<br>
and you and your kids and their kids will live under those rules. <br>
You say, &quot;I can design anything? There must be a catch?&quot; The genie says there is a <br>
catch. You don't know if you are going to be born black or white, rich or poor, male or <br>
female, infirm or able-bodied, bright or retarded. All you know is you are going to take <br>
one ball out of a barrel with 5.8 billion (balls). You are going to participate in the <br>
ovarian lottery. And that is going to be the most important thing in your life, because <br>
that is going to control whether you are born here or in Afghanistan or whether you are <br>
born with an IQ of 130 or an IQ of 70. It is going to determine a whole lot. What type of <br>
world are you going to design? <br>
I think it is a good way to look at social questions, because not knowing which ball you <br>
are going to get, you are going to want to design a system that is going to provide lots of <br>
goods and services because you want people on balance to live well. And you want it to <br>
produce more and more so your kids live better than you do and your grandchildren live <br>
better than their parents. But you also want a system that does produce lots of goods and <br>
services that does not leave behind a person who accidentally got the wrong ball and is <br>
not well wired for this particular system. I am ideally wired for the system I fell into <br>
here. I came out and got into something that enables me to allocate capital. Nothing so <br>
Buffett Talk to MBA Students at Florida University 1998. <br>
24<br>
wonderful about that. If all of us were stranded on a desert island somewhere and we<br>
were never going to get off of it, the most valuable person there would be the one who <br>
could raise the most rice over time. I can say, &quot;I can allocate capital!&quot; You wouldn't be <br>
very excited about that. So I have been born in the right place. <br>
Gates says that if I had been born three million years ago, I would have been some <br>
animal's lunch. He says, &quot;You can't run very fast, you can't climb trees, you can't do <br>
anything.&quot; You would just be chewed up the first day. You are lucky; you were born <br>
today. And I am. The question getting back, here is this barrel with 6.5 billion balls, <br>
everybody in the world, if you could put your ball back, and they took out at random a <br>
100 balls and you had to pick one of those, would you put your ball back in? <br>
Now those 100 balls you are going to get out, roughly 5 of them will be American, 95/5. <br>
So if you want to be in this country, you will only have 5 balls, half of them will be <br>
women and half men--I will let you decide how you will vote on that one. Half of them <br>
will below average in intelligence and half above average in intelligence. Do you want to <br>
put your ball in there? Most of you will not want to put your ball back to get 100. So <br>
what you are saying is: I am in the luckiest one percent of the world right now sitting in <br>
this room--the top one percent of the world. Well, that is the way I feel. I am lucky to be <br>
born where I was because it was 50 to 1 in the United States when I was born. I have <br>
been lucky with parents, lucky with all kinds of things and lucky to be wired in a way <br>
that in a market economy, pays off like crazy for me. It doesn't pay off as well for <br>
someone who is absolutely as good a citizen as I am (by) leading Boy Scout troops, <br>
teaching Sunday School or whatever, raising fine families, but just doesn't happen to be <br>
wired in the same way that I am. So I have been extremely lucky so I would like to be <br>
lucky again. <br>
Then the way to do it is to play out the game and do something you enjoy all your life <br>
and be associated with people you like. I only work with people I like. If I could make <br>
$100 million dollars with a guy who causes my stomach to churn, I would say no because <br>
in way that is very much like marrying for money which is probably not a very good idea <br>
in any circumstances, but if you are already rich, it is crazy. I am not going to marry for <br>
money. I would really do almost exactly what I have done except I wouldn't have bought <br>
the US Air. <br>
Thank you. <br>
END.
