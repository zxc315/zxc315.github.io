	旧约 -- 申命记(Deuteronomy) -- 第 32 章 ( 本篇共有 34 章 )<br />
<br />
<br />
32:1&nbsp; &nbsp; 诸天哪，侧耳，我要说话。愿地也听我口中的言语。<br />
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.<br />
<br />
32:2&nbsp; &nbsp; 我的教训要淋漓如雨。我的言语要滴落如露，如细雨降在嫩草上，如甘霖降在菜蔬中。<br />
My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:<br />
<br />
32:3&nbsp; &nbsp; 我要宣告耶和华的名。你们要将大德归与我们的神。<br />
Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.<br />
<br />
32:4&nbsp; &nbsp; 他是磐石，他的作为完全，他所行的无不公平，是诚实无伪的神。又公义，又正直。<br />
He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.<br />
<br />
32:5&nbsp; &nbsp; 这乖僻弯曲的世代向他行事邪僻。有这弊病就不是他的儿女。<br />
They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.<br />
<br />
32:6&nbsp; &nbsp; 愚昧无知的民哪，你们这样报答耶和华吗，他岂不是你的父，将你买来的吗，他是制造你，建立你的。<br />
Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?<br />
<br />
32:7&nbsp; &nbsp; 你当追想上古之日，思念历代之年。问你的父亲，他必指示你。问你的长者，他必告诉你。<br />
Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.<br />
<br />
32:8&nbsp; &nbsp; 至高者将地业赐给列邦，将世人分开，就照以色列人的数目立定万民的疆界。<br />
When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.<br />
<br />
32:9&nbsp; &nbsp; 耶和华的分本是他的百姓。他的产业本是雅各。<br />
For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.<br />
<br />
32:10&nbsp; &nbsp; 耶和华遇见他在旷野荒凉野兽吼叫之地，就环绕他，看顾他，保护他，如同保护眼中的瞳人。<br />
He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.<br />
<br />
32:11&nbsp; &nbsp; 又如鹰搅动巢窝，在雏鹰以上两翅扇展，接取雏鹰，背在两翼之上。<br />
As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:<br />
<br />
32:12&nbsp; &nbsp; 这样，耶和华独自引导他，并无外邦神与他同在。<br />
So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<br />
<br />
32:13&nbsp; &nbsp; 耶和华使他乘驾地的高处，得吃田间的土产。又使他从磐石中咂蜜，从坚石中吸油。<br />
He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;<br />
<br />
32:14&nbsp; &nbsp; 也吃牛的奶油，羊的奶，羊羔的脂油，巴珊所出的公绵羊和山羊，与上好的麦子，也喝葡萄汁酿的酒。<br />
Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.<br />
<br />
32:15&nbsp; &nbsp; 但耶书仑渐渐肥胖，粗壮，光润，踢跳奔跑，便离弃造他的神，轻看救他的磐石。<br />
But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.<br />
<br />
32:16&nbsp; &nbsp; 敬拜别神，触动神的愤恨，行可憎恶的事，惹了他的怒气。<br />
They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.<br />
<br />
32:17&nbsp; &nbsp; 所祭祀的鬼魔并非真神，乃是素不认识的神，是近来新兴的，是你列祖所不畏惧的<br />
They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.<br />
<br />
32:18&nbsp; &nbsp; 你轻忽生你的磐石，忘记产你的神。<br />
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.<br />
<br />
32:19&nbsp; &nbsp; 耶和华看见他的儿女惹动他，就厌恶他们，<br />
And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.<br />
<br />
32:20&nbsp; &nbsp; 说，我要向他们掩面，看他们的结局如何。他们本是极乖僻的族类，心中无诚实的儿女。<br />
And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.<br />
<br />
32:21&nbsp; &nbsp; 他们以那不算为神的触动我的愤恨，以虚无的神惹了我的怒气。我也要以那不成子民的触动他们的愤恨，以愚昧的国民惹了他们的怒气。<br />
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.<br />
<br />
32:22&nbsp; &nbsp; 因为在我怒中有火烧起，直烧到极深的阴间，把地和地的出产尽都焚烧，山的根基也烧着了。<br />
For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.<br />
<br />
32:23&nbsp; &nbsp; 我要将祸患堆在他们身上，把我的箭向他们射尽。<br />
I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.<br />
<br />
32:24&nbsp; &nbsp; 他们必因饥饿消瘦，被炎热苦毒吞灭。我要打发野兽用牙齿咬他们，并土中腹行的，用毒气害他们。<br />
They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.<br />
<br />
32:25&nbsp; &nbsp; 外头有刀剑，内室有惊恐，使人丧亡，使少男，童女，吃奶的，白发的，尽都灭绝。<br />
The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.<br />
<br />
32:26&nbsp; &nbsp; 我说，我必将他们分散远方，使他们的名号从人间除灭。<br />
I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:<br />
<br />
32:27&nbsp; &nbsp; 惟恐仇敌惹动我，只怕敌人错看，说，是我们手的能力，并非耶和华所行的。<br />
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.<br />
<br />
32:28&nbsp; &nbsp; 因为以色列民毫无计谋，心中没有聪明。<br />
For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.<br />
<br />
32:29&nbsp; &nbsp; 惟愿他们有智慧，能明白这事，肯思念他们的结局。<br />
O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!<br />
<br />
32:30&nbsp; &nbsp; 若不是他们的磐石卖了他们，若不是耶和华交出他们，一人焉能追赶他们千人，二人焉能使万人逃跑呢，<br />
How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?<br />
<br />
32:31&nbsp; &nbsp; 据我们的仇敌自己断定，他们的磐石不如我们的磐石。<br />
For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.<br />
<br />
32:32&nbsp; &nbsp; 他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，蛾摩拉田园所生的。他们的葡萄是毒葡萄，全挂都是苦的。<br />
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:<br />
<br />
32:33&nbsp; &nbsp; 他们的酒是大蛇的毒气，是虺蛇残害的恶毒。<br />
Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.<br />
<br />
32:34&nbsp; &nbsp; 这不都是积蓄在我这里，封锁在我府库中吗，<br />
Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?<br />
<br />
32:35&nbsp; &nbsp; 他们失脚的时候，伸冤报应在我。因他们遭灾的日子近了。那要临在他们身上的必速速来到。<br />
To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.<br />
<br />
32:36&nbsp; &nbsp; 耶和华见他百姓毫无能力，无论困住的，自由的都没有剩下，就必为他们伸冤，为他的仆人后悔。<br />
For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.<br />
<br />
32:37&nbsp; &nbsp; 他必说，他们的神，他们所投靠的磐石，<br />
And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,<br />
<br />
32:38&nbsp; &nbsp; 就是向来吃他们祭牲的脂油，喝他们奠祭之酒的，在哪里呢，他可以兴起帮助你们，护卫你们。<br />
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.<br />
<br />
32:39&nbsp; &nbsp; 你们如今要知道，我，惟有我是神。在我以外并无别神。我使人死，我使人活。我损伤，我也医治，并无人能从我手中救出来。<br />
See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.<br />
<br />
32:40&nbsp; &nbsp; 我向天举手说，我凭我的永生起誓，<br />
For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.<br />
<br />
32:41&nbsp; &nbsp; 我若磨我闪亮的刀，手掌审判之权，就必报复我的敌人，报应恨我的人。<br />
If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.<br />
<br />
32:42&nbsp; &nbsp; 我要使我的箭饮血饮醉，就是被杀被掳之人的血。我的刀要吃肉，乃是仇敌中首领之头的肉。<br />
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.<br />
<br />
32:43&nbsp; &nbsp; 你们外邦人当与主的百姓一同欢呼。因他要伸他仆人流血的冤，报应他的敌人，洁净他的地，救赎他的百姓。<br />
Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.<br />
<br />
32:44&nbsp; &nbsp; 摩西和嫩的儿子约书亚去将这歌的一切话说给百姓听。<br />
And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.<br />
<br />
32:45&nbsp; &nbsp; 摩西向以色列众人说完了这一切的话，<br />
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:<br />
<br />
32:46&nbsp; &nbsp; 又说，我今日所警教你们的，你们都要放在心上。要吩咐你们的子孙谨守遵行这律法上的话。<br />
And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.<br />
<br />
32:47&nbsp; &nbsp; 因为这不是虚空，与你们无关的事，乃是你们的生命。在你们过约旦河要得为业的地上必因这事日子得以长久。<br />
For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.<br />
<br />
32:48&nbsp; &nbsp; 当日，耶和华吩咐摩西说，<br />
And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,<br />
<br />
32:49&nbsp; &nbsp; 你上这亚巴琳山中的尼波山去，在摩押地与耶利哥相对，观看我所要赐给以色列人为业的迦南地。<br />
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:<br />
<br />
32:50&nbsp; &nbsp; 你必死在你所登的山上，归你列祖（原文作本民）去，像你哥哥亚伦死在何珥山上，归他的列祖一样。<br />
And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:<br />
<br />
32:51&nbsp; &nbsp; 因为你们在寻的旷野，加低斯的米利巴水，在以色列人中没有尊我为圣，得罪了我。<br />
Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.<br />
<br />
32:52&nbsp; &nbsp; 我所赐给以色列人的地，你可以远远地观看，却不得进去。<br />
Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.<br />
<br />
<br />
