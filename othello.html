<p> THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE</p>
<p> by William Shakespeare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Dramatis Personae</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO, the Moor, general of the Venetian forces</p>
<p> DESDEMONA, his wife</p>
<p> IAGO, ensign to Othello</p>
<p> EMILIA, his wife, lady-in-waiting to Desdemona</p>
<p> CASSIO, lieutenant to Othello</p>
<p> THE DUKE OF VENICE</p>
<p> BRABANTIO, Venetian Senator, father of Desdemona</p>
<p> GRATIANO, nobleman of Venice, brother of Brabantio</p>
<p> LODOVICO, nobleman of Venice, kinsman of Brabantio</p>
<p> RODERIGO, rejected suitor of Desdemona</p>
<p> BIANCA, mistress of Cassio</p>
<p> MONTANO, a Cypriot official</p>
<p> A Clown in service to Othello</p>
<p> Senators, Sailors, Messengers, Officers, Gentlemen, Musicians, and</p>
<p> Attendants</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> SCENE: Venice and Cyprus</p>
<p> ACT I. SCENE I.</p>
<p> Venice. A street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Roderigo and Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> RODERIGO. O never tell me! I take it much unkindly</p>
<p> That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</p>
<p> As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</p>
<p> IAGO. 'Sblood, but you will not hear me.</p>
<p> If ever I did dream of such a matter,</p>
<p> Abhor me.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</p>
<p> IAGO. Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</p>
<p> In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</p>
<p> Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,</p>
<p> I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</p>
<p> But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,</p>
<p> Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance</p>
<p> Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war,</p>
<p> And, in conclusion,</p>
<p> Nonsuits my mediators; for, &quot;Certes,&quot; says he,</p>
<p> &quot;I have already chose my officer.&quot;</p>
<p> And what was he?</p>
<p> Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</p>
<p> One Michael Cassio, a Florentine</p>
<p> (A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife)</p>
<p> That never set a squadron in the field,</p>
<p> Nor the division of a battle knows</p>
<p> More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</p>
<p> Wherein the toged consuls can propose</p>
<p> As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice</p>
<p> Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;</p>
<p> And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</p>
<p> At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</p>
<p> Christian and heathen, must be belee'd and calm'd</p>
<p> By debator and creditor. This counter-caster,</p>
<p> He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</p>
<p> And I- God bless the mark!- his Moorship's ancient.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service,</p>
<p> Preferment goes by letter and affection,</p>
<p> And not by old gradation, where each second</p>
<p> Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</p>
<p> Whether I in any just term am affined</p>
<p> To love the Moor.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I would not follow him then.</p>
<p> IAGO. O, sir, content you.</p>
<p> I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</p>
<p> We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</p>
<p> Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</p>
<p> Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</p>
<p> That doting on his own obsequious bondage</p>
<p> Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</p>
<p> For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd.</p>
<p> Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</p>
<p> Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</p>
<p> Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves</p>
<p> And throwing but shows of service on their lords</p>
<p> Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats</p>
<p> Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</p>
<p> And such a one do I profess myself.</p>
<p> For, sir,</p>
<p> It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</p>
<p> Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.</p>
<p> In following him, I follow but myself;</p>
<p> Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</p>
<p> But seeming so, for my peculiar end.</p>
<p> For when my outward action doth demonstrate</p>
<p> The native act and figure of my heart</p>
<p> In complement extern, 'tis not long after</p>
<p> But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</p>
<p> For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,</p>
<p> If he can carry't thus!</p>
<p> IAGO. Call up her father,</p>
<p> Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</p>
<p> Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,</p>
<p> And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</p>
<p> Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</p>
<p> Yet throw such changes of vexation on't</p>
<p> As it may lose some color.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Here is her father's house; I'll call a loud.</p>
<p> IAGO. Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</p>
<p> As when, by night and negligence, the fire</p>
<p> Is spied in populous cities.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</p>
<p> IAGO. Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!</p>
<p> Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!</p>
<p> Thieves! Thieves!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Brabantio appears above, at a window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. What is there a son of this terrible summons?</p>
<p> What is the matter there?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Signior, is all your family within?</p>
<p> IAGO. Are your doors lock'd?</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Why? Wherefore ask you this?</p>
<p> IAGO. 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd! For shame, put on your gown;</p>
<p> Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</p>
<p> Even now, very now, an old black ram</p>
<p> Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise!</p>
<p> Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</p>
<p> Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.</p>
<p> Arise, I say!</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. What, have you lost your have wits?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Not I. What are you?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. My name is Roderigo.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. The worser welcome.</p>
<p> I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.</p>
<p> In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</p>
<p> My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</p>
<p> Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</p>
<p> Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</p>
<p> To start my quiet.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Sir, sir, sir-</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. But thou must needs be sure</p>
<p> My spirit and my place have in them power</p>
<p> To make this bitter to thee.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Patience, good sir.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. What tell'st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;</p>
<p> My house is not a grange.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Most grave Brabantio,</p>
<p> In simple and pure soul I come to you.</p>
<p> IAGO. 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God,</p>
<p> if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you</p>
<p> think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a</p>
<p> Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</p>
<p> coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. What profane wretch art thou?</p>
<p> IAGO. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the</p>
<p> Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Thou are a villain.</p>
<p> IAGO. You are- a senator.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you,</p>
<p> If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</p>
<p> As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</p>
<p> At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</p>
<p> Transported with no worse nor better guard</p>
<p> But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</p>
<p> To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor-</p>
<p> If this be known to you, and your allowance,</p>
<p> We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</p>
<p> But if you know not this, my manners tell me</p>
<p> We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</p>
<p> That, from the sense of all civility,</p>
<p> I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</p>
<p> Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</p>
<p> I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</p>
<p> Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</p>
<p> In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</p>
<p> Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:</p>
<p> If she be in her chamber or your house,</p>
<p> Let loose on me the justice of the state</p>
<p> For thus deluding you.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Strike on the tinder, ho!</p>
<p> Give me a taper! Call up all my people!</p>
<p> This accident is not unlike my dream;</p>
<p> Belief of it oppresses me already.</p>
<p> Light, I say, light!                             Exit above.</p>
<p> IAGO. Farewell, for I must leave you.</p>
<p> It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</p>
<p> To be produced- as, if I stay, I shall-</p>
<p> Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,</p>
<p> However this may gall him with some check,</p>
<p> Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</p>
<p> With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</p>
<p> Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,</p>
<p> Another of his fathom they have none</p>
<p> To lead their business; in which regard,</p>
<p> Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,</p>
<p> Yet for necessity of present life,</p>
<p> I must show out a flag and sign of love,</p>
<p> Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</p>
<p> Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,</p>
<p> And there will I be with him. So farewell.             Exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter, below, Brabantio, in his nightgown, and</p>
<p> Servants with torches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. It is too true an evil: gone she is,</p>
<p> And what's to come of my despised time</p>
<p> Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</p>
<p> Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</p>
<p> With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</p>
<p> How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me</p>
<p> Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers.</p>
<p> Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Truly, I think they are.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</p>
<p> Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds</p>
<p> By what you see them act. Is there not charms</p>
<p> By which the property of youth and maidhood</p>
<p> May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</p>
<p> Of some such thing?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Yes, sir, I have indeed.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</p>
<p> Some one way, some another. Do you know</p>
<p> Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I think I can discover him, if you please</p>
<p> To get good guard and go along with me.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;</p>
<p> I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</p>
<p> And raise some special officers of night.</p>
<p> On, good Roderigo, I'll deserve your pains.          Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE II.</p>
<p> Another street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello, Iago, and Attendants with torches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</p>
<p> Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience</p>
<p> To do no contrived murther. I lack iniquity</p>
<p> Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times</p>
<p> I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. 'Tis better as it is.</p>
<p> IAGO. Nay, but he prated</p>
<p> And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</p>
<p> Against your honor</p>
<p> That, with the little godliness I have,</p>
<p> I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,</p>
<p> Are you fast married? Be assured of this,</p>
<p> That the magnifico is much beloved,</p>
<p> And hath in his effect a voice potential</p>
<p> As double as the Duke's. He will divorce you,</p>
<p> Or put upon you what restraint and grievance</p>
<p> The law, with all his might to enforce it on,</p>
<p> Will give him cable.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Let him do his spite.</p>
<p> My services, which I have done the signiory,</p>
<p> Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know-</p>
<p> Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,</p>
<p> I shall promulgate- I fetch my life and being</p>
<p> From men of royal siege, and my demerits</p>
<p> May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune</p>
<p> As this that I have reach'd. For know, Iago,</p>
<p> But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</p>
<p> I would not my unhoused free condition</p>
<p> Put into circumscription and confine</p>
<p> For the sea's worth. But, look! What lights come yond?</p>
<p> IAGO. Those are the raised father and his friends.</p>
<p> You were best go in.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Not I; I must be found.</p>
<p> My parts, my title, and my perfect soul</p>
<p> Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?</p>
<p> IAGO. By Janus, I think no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Cassio and certain Officers with torches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant?</p>
<p> The goodness of the night upon you, friends!</p>
<p> What is the news?</p>
<p> CASSIO. The Duke does greet you, general,</p>
<p> And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,</p>
<p> Even on the instant.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What is the matter, think you?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;</p>
<p> It is a business of some heat. The galleys</p>
<p> Have sent a dozen sequent messengers</p>
<p> This very night at one another's heels;</p>
<p> And many of the consuls, raised and met,</p>
<p> Are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for,</p>
<p> When, being not at your lodging to be found,</p>
<p> The Senate hath sent about three several quests</p>
<p> To search you out.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. 'Tis well I am found by you.</p>
<p> I will but spend a word here in the house</p>
<p> And go with you.                                       Exit.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Ancient, what makes he here?</p>
<p> IAGO. Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;</p>
<p> If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I do not understand.</p>
<p> IAGO. He's married.</p>
<p> CASSIO. To who?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Othello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. Marry, to- Come, captain, will you go?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Have with you.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Here comes another troop to seek for you.</p>
<p> IAGO. It is Brabantio. General, be advised,</p>
<p> He comes to bad intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Officers with torches</p>
<p> and weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Holla! Stand there!</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Signior, it is the Moor.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Down with him, thief!</p>
<p> They draw on both sides.</p>
<p> IAGO. You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.</p>
<p> Good signior, you shall more command with years</p>
<p> Than with your weapons.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?</p>
<p> Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,</p>
<p> For I'll refer me to all things of sense,</p>
<p> If she in chains of magic were not bound,</p>
<p> Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,</p>
<p> So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd</p>
<p> The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation,</p>
<p> Would ever have, to incur a general mock,</p>
<p> Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom</p>
<p> Of such a thing as thou- to fear, not to delight.</p>
<p> Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense</p>
<p> That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,</p>
<p> Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals</p>
<p> That weaken motion. I'll have't disputed on;</p>
<p> 'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.</p>
<p> I therefore apprehend and do attach thee</p>
<p> For an abuser of the world, a practicer</p>
<p> Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.</p>
<p> Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,</p>
<p> Subdue him at his peril.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Hold your hands,</p>
<p> Both you of my inclining and the rest.</p>
<p> Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it</p>
<p> Without a prompter. Where will you that I go</p>
<p> To answer this your charge?</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. To prison, till fit time</p>
<p> Of law and course of direct session</p>
<p> Call thee to answer.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What if I do obey?</p>
<p> How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,</p>
<p> Whose messengers are here about my side,</p>
<p> Upon some present business of the state</p>
<p> To bring me to him?</p>
<p> FIRST OFFICER. 'Tis true, most worthy signior;</p>
<p> The Duke's in council, and your noble self,</p>
<p> I am sure, is sent for.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. How? The Duke in council?</p>
<p> In this time of the night? Bring him away;</p>
<p> Mine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself,</p>
<p> Or any of my brothers of the state,</p>
<p> Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;</p>
<p> For if such actions may have passage free,</p>
<p> Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.       Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE III.</p>
<p> A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting</p>
<p> at a table; Officers attending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DUKE. There is no composition in these news</p>
<p> That gives them credit.</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. Indeed they are disproportion'd;</p>
<p> My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.</p>
<p> DUKE. And mine, a hundred and forty.</p>
<p> SECOND SENATOR. And mine, two hundred.</p>
<p> But though they jump not on a just account-</p>
<p> As in these cases, where the aim reports,</p>
<p> 'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm</p>
<p> A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.</p>
<p> DUKE. Nay, it is possible enough to judgement.</p>
<p> I do not so secure me in the error,</p>
<p> But the main article I do approve</p>
<p> In fearful sense.</p>
<p> SAILOR. [Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!</p>
<p> FIRST OFFICER. A messenger from the galleys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Sailor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DUKE. Now, what's the business?</p>
<p> SAILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,</p>
<p> So was I bid report here to the state</p>
<p> By Signior Angelo.</p>
<p> DUKE. How say you by this change?</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. This cannot be,</p>
<p> By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant</p>
<p> To keep us in false gaze. When we consider</p>
<p> The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,</p>
<p> And let ourselves again but understand</p>
<p> That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,</p>
<p> So may he with more facile question bear it,</p>
<p> For that it stands not in such warlike brace,</p>
<p> But altogether lacks the abilities</p>
<p> That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,</p>
<p> We must not think the Turk is so unskillful</p>
<p> To leave that latest which concerns him first,</p>
<p> Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,</p>
<p> To wake and wage a danger profitless.</p>
<p> DUKE. Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.</p>
<p> FIRST OFFICER. Here is more news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter a Messenger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> MESSENGER. The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,</p>
<p> Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,</p>
<p> Have there injointed them with an after fleet.</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?</p>
<p> MESSENGER. Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem</p>
<p> Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance</p>
<p> Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,</p>
<p> Your trusty and most valiant servitor,</p>
<p> With his free duty recommends you thus,</p>
<p> And prays you to believe him.</p>
<p> DUKE. 'Tis certain then for Cyprus.</p>
<p> Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. He's now in Florence.</p>
<p> DUKE. Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch.</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo, and Officers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DUKE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you</p>
<p> Against the general enemy Ottoman.</p>
<p> [To Brabantio.] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;</p>
<p> We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me:</p>
<p> Neither my place nor aught I heard of business</p>
<p> Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care</p>
<p> Take hold on me; for my particular grief</p>
<p> Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature</p>
<p> That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,</p>
<p> And it is still itself.</p>
<p> DUKE. Why, what's the matter?</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. My daughter! O, my daughter!</p>
<p> ALL. Dead?</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Ay, to me.</p>
<p> She is abused, stol'n from me and corrupted</p>
<p> By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;</p>
<p> For nature so preposterously to err,</p>
<p> Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,</p>
<p> Sans witchcraft could not.</p>
<p> DUKE. Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding</p>
<p> Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself</p>
<p> And you of her, the bloody book of law</p>
<p> You shall yourself read in the bitter letter</p>
<p> After your own sense, yea, though our proper son</p>
<p> Stood in your action.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Humbly I thank your Grace.</p>
<p> Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,</p>
<p> Your special mandate for the state affairs</p>
<p> Hath hither brought.</p>
<p> ALL. We are very sorry for't.</p>
<p> DUKE. [To Othello.] What in your own part can you say to this?</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</p>
<p> My very noble and approved good masters,</p>
<p> That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</p>
<p> It is most true; true, I have married her;</p>
<p> The very head and front of my offending</p>
<p> Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</p>
<p> And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;</p>
<p> For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</p>
<p> Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</p>
<p> Their dearest action in the tented field,</p>
<p> And little of this great world can I speak,</p>
<p> More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;</p>
<p> And therefore little shall I grace my cause</p>
<p> In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</p>
<p> I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</p>
<p> Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,</p>
<p> What conjuration, and what mighty magic-</p>
<p> For such proceeding I am charged withal-</p>
<p> I won his daughter.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. A maiden never bold,</p>
<p> Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion</p>
<p> Blush'd at herself; and she- in spite of nature,</p>
<p> Of years, of country, credit, everything-</p>
<p> To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</p>
<p> It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect,</p>
<p> That will confess perfection so could err</p>
<p> Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</p>
<p> To find out practices of cunning hell</p>
<p> Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</p>
<p> That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,</p>
<p> Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</p>
<p> He wrought upon her.</p>
<p> DUKE. To vouch this is no proof,</p>
<p> Without more certain and more overt test</p>
<p> Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods</p>
<p> Of modern seeming do prefer against him.</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.</p>
<p> Did you by indirect and forced courses</p>
<p> Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?</p>
<p> Or came it by request, and such fair question</p>
<p> As soul to soul affordeth?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I do beseech you,</p>
<p> Send for the lady to the Sagittary,</p>
<p> And let her speak of me before her father.</p>
<p> If you do find me foul in her report,</p>
<p> The trust, the office I do hold of you,</p>
<p> Not only take away, but let your sentence</p>
<p> Even fall upon my life.</p>
<p> DUKE. Fetch Desdemona hither.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.</p>
<p> Exeunt Iago and Attendants.</p>
<p> And till she come, as truly as to heaven</p>
<p> I do confess the vices of my blood,</p>
<p> So justly to your grave ears I'll present</p>
<p> How I did thrive in this fair lady's love</p>
<p> And she in mine.</p>
<p> DUKE. Say it, Othello.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,</p>
<p> Still question'd me the story of my life</p>
<p> From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,</p>
<p> That I have pass'd.</p>
<p> I ran it through, even from my boyish days</p>
<p> To the very moment that he bade me tell it:</p>
<p> Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</p>
<p> Of moving accidents by flood and field,</p>
<p> Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,</p>
<p> Of being taken by the insolent foe</p>
<p> And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</p>
<p> And portance in my travels' history;</p>
<p> Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</p>
<p> Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,</p>
<p> It was my hint to speak- such was the process-</p>
<p> And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</p>
<p> The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads</p>
<p> Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear</p>
<p> Would Desdemona seriously incline;</p>
<p> But still the house affairs would draw her thence,</p>
<p> Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</p>
<p> She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear</p>
<p> Devour up my discourse; which I observing,</p>
<p> Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</p>
<p> To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</p>
<p> That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</p>
<p> Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</p>
<p> But not intentively. I did consent,</p>
<p> And often did beguile her of her tears</p>
<p> When I did speak of some distressful stroke</p>
<p> That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</p>
<p> She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;</p>
<p> She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;</p>
<p> 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.</p>
<p> She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd</p>
<p> That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,</p>
<p> And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</p>
<p> I should but teach him how to tell my story,</p>
<p> And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</p>
<p> She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,</p>
<p> And I loved her that she did pity them.</p>
<p> This only is the witchcraft I have used.</p>
<p> Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DUKE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.</p>
<p> Good Brabantio,</p>
<p> Take up this mangled matter at the best:</p>
<p> Men do their broken weapons rather use</p>
<p> Than their bare hands.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. I pray you, hear her speak.</p>
<p> If she confess that she was half the wooer,</p>
<p> Destruction on my head, if my bad blame</p>
<p> Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress.</p>
<p> Do you perceive in all this noble company</p>
<p> Where most you owe obedience?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My noble father,</p>
<p> I do perceive here a divided duty.</p>
<p> To you I am bound for life and education;</p>
<p> My life and education both do learn me</p>
<p> How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,</p>
<p> I am hitherto your daughter. But here's my husband,</p>
<p> And so much duty as my mother show'd</p>
<p> To you, preferring you before her father,</p>
<p> So much I challenge that I may profess</p>
<p> Due to the Moor, my lord.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. God be with you! I have done.</p>
<p> Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs;</p>
<p> I had rather to adopt a child than get it.</p>
<p> Come hither, Moor.</p>
<p> I here do give thee that with all my heart</p>
<p> Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart</p>
<p> I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,</p>
<p> I am glad at soul I have no other child;</p>
<p> For thy escape would teach me tyranny,</p>
<p> To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.</p>
<p> DUKE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence</p>
<p> Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers</p>
<p> Into your favor.</p>
<p> When remedies are past, the griefs are ended</p>
<p> By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</p>
<p> To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</p>
<p> Is the next way to draw new mischief on.</p>
<p> What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes,</p>
<p> Patience her injury a mockery makes.</p>
<p> The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;</p>
<p> He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;</p>
<p> We lose it not so long as we can smile.</p>
<p> He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears</p>
<p> But the free comfort which from thence he hears;</p>
<p> But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow</p>
<p> That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.</p>
<p> These sentences, to sugar or to gall,</p>
<p> Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.</p>
<p> But words are words; I never yet did hear</p>
<p> That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.</p>
<p> I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.</p>
<p> DUKE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.</p>
<p> Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and</p>
<p> though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency,</p>
<p> yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer</p>
<p> voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss</p>
<p> of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous</p>
<p> expedition.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,</p>
<p> Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war</p>
<p> My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize</p>
<p> A natural and prompt alacrity</p>
<p> I find in hardness and do undertake</p>
<p> These present wars against the Ottomites.</p>
<p> Most humbly therefore bending to your state,</p>
<p> I crave fit disposition for my wife,</p>
<p> Due reference of place and exhibition,</p>
<p> With such accommodation and besort</p>
<p> As levels with her breeding.</p>
<p> DUKE. If you please,</p>
<p> Be't at her father's.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. I'll not have it so.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nor I.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Nor I. I would not there reside</p>
<p> To put my father in impatient thoughts</p>
<p> By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke,</p>
<p> To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,</p>
<p> And let me find a charter in your voice</p>
<p> To assist my simpleness.</p>
<p> DUKE. What would you, Desdemona?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him,</p>
<p> My downright violence and storm of fortunes</p>
<p> May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued</p>
<p> Even to the very quality of my lord.</p>
<p> I saw Othello's visage in his mind,</p>
<p> And to his honors and his valiant parts</p>
<p> Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.</p>
<p> So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,</p>
<p> A moth of peace, and he go to the war,</p>
<p> The rites for which I love him are bereft me,</p>
<p> And I a heavy interim shall support</p>
<p> By his dear absence. Let me go with him.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Let her have your voices.</p>
<p> Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not</p>
<p> To please the palate of my appetite,</p>
<p> Nor to comply with heat- the young affects</p>
<p> In me defunct- and proper satisfaction;</p>
<p> But to be free and bounteous to her mind.</p>
<p> And heaven defend your good souls, that you think</p>
<p> I will your serious and great business scant</p>
<p> For she is with me. No, when light-wing'd toys</p>
<p> Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness</p>
<p> My speculative and officed instruments,</p>
<p> That my disports corrupt and taint my business,</p>
<p> Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,</p>
<p> And all indign and base adversities</p>
<p> Make head against my estimation!</p>
<p> DUKE. Be it as you shall privately determine,</p>
<p> Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,</p>
<p> And speed must answer't: you must hence tonight.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Tonight, my lord?</p>
<p> DUKE. This night.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. With all my heart.</p>
<p> DUKE. At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.</p>
<p> Othello, leave some officer behind,</p>
<p> And he shall our commission bring to you,</p>
<p> With such things else of quality and respect</p>
<p> As doth import you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. So please your Grace, my ancient;</p>
<p> A man he is of honesty and trust.</p>
<p> To his conveyance I assign my wife,</p>
<p> With what else needful your good Grace shall think</p>
<p> To be sent after me.</p>
<p> DUKE. Let it be so.</p>
<p> Good night to everyone. [To Brabantio.] And, noble signior,</p>
<p> If virtue no delighted beauty lack,</p>
<p> Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.</p>
<p> FIRST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.</p>
<p> BRABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;</p>
<p> She has deceived her father, and may thee.</p>
<p> Exeunt Duke, Senators, and Officers.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,</p>
<p> My Desdemona must I leave to thee.</p>
<p> I prithee, let thy wife attend on her,</p>
<p> And bring them after in the best advantage.</p>
<p> Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour</p>
<p> Of love, of worldly matters and direction,</p>
<p> To spend with thee. We must obey the time.</p>
<p> Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Iago!</p>
<p> IAGO. What say'st thou, noble heart?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, go to bed and sleep.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.</p>
<p> IAGO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.</p>
<p> Why, thou silly gentleman!</p>
<p> RODERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then</p>
<p> have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.</p>
<p> IAGO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times</p>
<p> seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and</p>
<p> an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I</p>
<p> would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I</p>
<p> would change my humanity with a baboon.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,</p>
<p> but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</p>
<p> IAGO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.</p>
<p> Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so</p>
<p> that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed</p>
<p> up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with</p>
<p> many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with</p>
<p> industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in</p>
<p> our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of</p>
<p> reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of</p>
<p> our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions.</p>
<p> But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings,</p>
<p> our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to</p>
<p> be a sect or scion.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. It cannot be.</p>
<p> IAGO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the</p>
<p> will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind</p>
<p> puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to</p>
<p> thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</p>
<p> better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou</p>
<p> the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put</p>
<p> money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long</p>
<p> continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his</p>
<p> to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an</p>
<p> answerable sequestration-put but money in thy purse. These Moors</p>
<p> are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money. The</p>
<p> food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him</p>
<p> shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth;</p>
<p> when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her</p>
<p> choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in</p>
<p> thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate</p>
<p> way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony</p>
<p> and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle</p>
<p> Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell,</p>
<p> thou shalt enjoy  her- therefore make money. A pox of drowning</p>
<p> thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be</p>
<p> hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without</p>
<p> her.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?</p>
<p> IAGO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,</p>
<p> and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is</p>
<p> hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our</p>
<p> revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself</p>
<p> a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time</p>
<p> which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will</p>
<p> have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?</p>
<p> IAGO. At my lodging.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I'll be with thee betimes.</p>
<p> IAGO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. What say you?</p>
<p> IAGO. No more of drowning, do you hear?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.        Exit.</p>
<p> IAGO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;</p>
<p> For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane</p>
<p> If I would time expend with such a snipe</p>
<p> But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,</p>
<p> And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets</p>
<p> He has done my office. I know not if't be true,</p>
<p> But I for mere suspicion in that kind</p>
<p> Will do as if for surety. He holds me well,</p>
<p> The better shall my purpose work on him.</p>
<p> Cassio's a proper man. Let me see now-</p>
<p> To get his place, and to plume up my will</p>
<p> In double knavery- How, how?- Let's see-</p>
<p> After some time, to abuse Othello's ear</p>
<p> That he is too familiar with his wife.</p>
<p> He hath a person and a smooth dispose</p>
<p> To be suspected- framed to make women false.</p>
<p> The Moor is of a free and open nature,</p>
<p> That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,</p>
<p> And will as tenderly be led by the nose</p>
<p> As asses are.</p>
<p> I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night</p>
<p> Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.</p>
<p> Exit.</p>
<p> ACT II. SCENE I.</p>
<p> A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> MONTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?</p>
<p> FIRST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;</p>
<p> I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,</p>
<p> Descry a sail.</p>
<p> MONTANO. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;</p>
<p> A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.</p>
<p> If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,</p>
<p> What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,</p>
<p> Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?</p>
<p> SECOND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet.</p>
<p> For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</p>
<p> The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;</p>
<p> The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,</p>
<p> Seems to cast water on the burning bear,</p>
<p> And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.</p>
<p> I never did like molestation view</p>
<p> On the enchafed flood.</p>
<p> MONTANO. If that the Turkish fleet</p>
<p> Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;</p>
<p> It is impossible to bear it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter a third Gentleman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> THIRD GENTLEMAN. News, lads! Our wars are done.</p>
<p> The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,</p>
<p> That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice</p>
<p> Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance</p>
<p> On most part of their fleet.</p>
<p> MONTANO. How? Is this true?</p>
<p> THIRD GENTLEMAN. The ship is here put in,</p>
<p> A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,</p>
<p> Lieutenant to the warlike Moor, Othello,</p>
<p> Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,</p>
<p> And is in full commission here for Cyprus.</p>
<p> MONTANO. I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.</p>
<p> THIRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</p>
<p> Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly</p>
<p> And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted</p>
<p> With foul and violent tempest.</p>
<p> MONTANO. Pray heavens he be,</p>
<p> For I have served him, and the man commands</p>
<p> Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!</p>
<p> As well to see the vessel that's come in</p>
<p> As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</p>
<p> Even till we make the main and the aerial blue</p>
<p> An indistinct regard.</p>
<p> THIRD GENTLEMAN. Come, let's do so,</p>
<p> For every minute is expectancy</p>
<p> Of more arrivance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Cassio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CASSIO. Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,</p>
<p> That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens</p>
<p> Give him defense against the elements,</p>
<p> For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.</p>
<p> MONTANO. I she well shipp'd?</p>
<p> CASSIO. His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot</p>
<p> Of very expert and approved allowance;</p>
<p> Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</p>
<p> Stand in bold cure.</p>
<p> A cry within, &quot;A sail, a sail, a sail!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter a fourth Gentleman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> What noise?</p>
<p> FOURTH GENTLEMAN. The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea</p>
<p> Stand ranks of people, and they cry, &quot;A sail!&quot;</p>
<p> CASSIO. My hopes do shape him for the governor.</p>
<p> Guns heard.</p>
<p> SECOND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge their shot of courtesy-</p>
<p> Our friends at least.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I pray you, sir, go forth,</p>
<p> And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.</p>
<p> SECOND GENTLEMAN. I shall.                               Exit.</p>
<p> MONTANO. But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid</p>
<p> That paragons description and wild fame,</p>
<p> One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,</p>
<p> And in the essential vesture of creation</p>
<p> Does tire the ingener.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter second Gentleman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> How now! who has put in?</p>
<p> SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.</p>
<p> CASSIO. He has had most favorable and happy speed:</p>
<p> Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,</p>
<p> The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands,</p>
<p> Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,</p>
<p> As having sense of beauty, do omit</p>
<p> Their mortal natures, letting go safely by</p>
<p> The divine Desdemona.</p>
<p> MONTANO. What is she?</p>
<p> CASSIO. She that I spoke of, our great captain's captain,</p>
<p> Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,</p>
<p> Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts</p>
<p> A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,</p>
<p> And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,</p>
<p> That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,</p>
<p> Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,</p>
<p> Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,</p>
<p> And bring all Cyprus comfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Desdemona, Emilia Iago, Roderigo, and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> O, behold,</p>
<p> The riches of the ship is come on shore!</p>
<p> Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.</p>
<p> Hall to thee, lady! And the grace of heaven,</p>
<p> Before, behind thee, and on every hand,</p>
<p> Enwheel thee round!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I thank you, valiant Cassio.</p>
<p> What tidings can you tell me of my lord?</p>
<p> CASSIO. He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught</p>
<p> But that he's well and will be shortly here.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, but I fear- How lost you company?</p>
<p> CASSIO. The great contention of the sea and skies</p>
<p> Parted our fellowship- But, hark! a sail.</p>
<p> A cry within, &quot;A sail, a sail!&quot; Guns heard.</p>
<p> SECOND GENTLEMAN. They give their greeting to the citadel;</p>
<p> This likewise is a friend.</p>
<p> CASSIO. See for the news.</p>
<p> Exit Gentleman.</p>
<p> Good ancient, you are welcome. [To Emilia.] Welcome, mistress.</p>
<p> Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,</p>
<p> That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding</p>
<p> That gives me this bold show of courtesy.        Kisses her.</p>
<p> IAGO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</p>
<p> As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,</p>
<p> You'ld have enough.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Alas, she has no speech.</p>
<p> IAGO. In faith, too much;</p>
<p> I find it still when I have list to sleep.</p>
<p> Marry, before your ladyship I grant,</p>
<p> She puts her tongue a little in her heart</p>
<p> And chides with thinking.</p>
<p> EMILIA. You have little cause to say so.</p>
<p> IAGO. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,</p>
<p> Bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,</p>
<p> Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,</p>
<p> Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer!</p>
<p> IAGO. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:</p>
<p> You rise to play, and go to bed to work.</p>
<p> EMILIA. You shall not write my praise.</p>
<p> IAGO. No, let me not.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise</p>
<p> me?</p>
<p> IAGO. O gentle lady, do not put me to't,</p>
<p> For I am nothing if not critical.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?</p>
<p> IAGO. Ay, madam.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I am not merry, but I do beguile</p>
<p> The thing I am by seeming otherwise.</p>
<p> Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</p>
<p> IAGO. I am about it, but indeed my invention</p>
<p> Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze;</p>
<p> It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors,</p>
<p> And thus she is deliver'd.</p>
<p> If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</p>
<p> The one's for use, the other useth it.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</p>
<p> IAGO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,</p>
<p> She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Worse and worse.</p>
<p> EMILIA. How if fair and foolish?</p>
<p> IAGO. She never yet was foolish that was fair,</p>
<p> For even her folly help'd her to an heir.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the</p>
<p> alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and</p>
<p> foolish?</p>
<p> IAGO. There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,</p>
<p> But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what</p>
<p> praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that</p>
<p> in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very</p>
<p> malice itself?</p>
<p> IAGO. She that was ever fair and never proud,</p>
<p> Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,</p>
<p> Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,</p>
<p> Fled from her wish and yet said, &quot;Now I may&quot;;</p>
<p> She that, being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,</p>
<p> Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;</p>
<p> She that in wisdom never was so frail</p>
<p> To change the cod's head for the salmon's tall;</p>
<p> She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,</p>
<p> See suitors following and not look behind;</p>
<p> She was a wight, if ever such wight were-</p>
<p> DESDEMONA To do what?</p>
<p> IAGO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,</p>
<p> Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not</p>
<p> a most profane and liberal counselor?</p>
<p> CASSIO. He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the</p>
<p> soldier than in the scholar.</p>
<p> IAGO. [Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.</p>
<p> With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as</p>
<p> Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own</p>
<p> courtship. You say true; 'tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these</p>
<p> strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had</p>
<p> not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are</p>
<p> most apt to play the sir in. Very good. Well kissed! an excellent</p>
<p> courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips?</p>
<p> Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! [Trumpet within.]</p>
<p> The Moor! I know his trumpet.</p>
<p> CASSIO. 'Tis truly so.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Let's meet him and receive him.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Lo, where he comes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O my fair warrior!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My dear Othello!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. It gives me wonder great as my content</p>
<p> To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!</p>
<p> If after every tempest come such calms,</p>
<p> May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!</p>
<p> And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas</p>
<p> Olympus-high, and duck again as low</p>
<p> As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,</p>
<p> 'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear</p>
<p> My soul hath her content so absolute</p>
<p> That not another comfort like to this</p>
<p> Succeeds in unknown fate.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. The heavens forbid</p>
<p> But that our loves and comforts should increase,</p>
<p> Even as our days do grow!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Amen to that, sweet powers!</p>
<p> I cannot speak enough of this content;</p>
<p> It stops me here; it is too much of joy.</p>
<p> And this, and this, the greatest discords be     Kisses her.</p>
<p> That e'er our hearts shall make!</p>
<p> IAGO. [Aside.] O, you are well tuned now!</p>
<p> But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,</p>
<p> As honest as I am.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Come, let us to the castle.</p>
<p> News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.</p>
<p> How does my old acquaintance of this isle?</p>
<p> Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;</p>
<p> I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,</p>
<p> I prattle out of fashion, and I dote</p>
<p> In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,</p>
<p> Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.</p>
<p> Bring thou the master to the citadel;</p>
<p> He is a good one, and his worthiness</p>
<p> Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,</p>
<p> Once more well met at Cyprus.</p>
<p> Exeunt all but Iago and Roderigo.</p>
<p> IAGO. Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou</p>
<p> best valiant-as they say base men being in love have then a</p>
<p> nobility in their natures more than is native to them- list me.<br />
</p>
<p> The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I</p>
<p> must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. With him? Why, 'tis not possible.</p>
<p> IAGO. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me</p>
<p> with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and</p>
<p> telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for</p>
<p> prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be</p>
<p> fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When</p>
<p> the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be,</p>
<p> again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite,</p>
<p> loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties-</p>
<p> all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these</p>
<p> required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself</p>
<p> abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor;</p>
<p> very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second</p>
<p> choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and</p>
<p> unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this</p>
<p> fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further</p>
<p> conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane</p>
<p> seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose</p>
<p> affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a</p>
<p> finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and</p>
<p> counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present</p>
<p> itself-a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,</p>
<p> and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds</p>
<p> look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found</p>
<p> him already.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest</p>
<p> condition.</p>
<p> IAGO. Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If</p>
<p> she had been blest, she would never have loved the Moor. Blest</p>
<p> pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?</p>
<p> Didst not mark that?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</p>
<p> IAGO. Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the</p>
<p> history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their</p>
<p> lips that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts,</p>
<p> Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand</p>
<p> comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion.</p>
<p> Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from</p>
<p> Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I'll lay't upon you.</p>
<p> Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you. Do you find some</p>
<p> occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or</p>
<p> tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please,</p>
<p> which the time shall more favorably minister.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Well.</p>
<p> IAGO. Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may</p>
<p> strike at you. Provoke him, that he may; for even out of that</p>
<p> will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall</p>
<p> come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.</p>
<p> So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means</p>
<p> I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most</p>
<p> profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation</p>
<p> of our prosperity.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.</p>
<p> IAGO. I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must</p>
<p> fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Adieu.                                         Exit.</p>
<p> IAGO. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;</p>
<p> That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.</p>
<p> The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,</p>
<p> Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</p>
<p> And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona</p>
<p> A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,</p>
<p> Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure</p>
<p> I stand accountant for as great a sin,</p>
<p> But partly led to diet my revenge,</p>
<p> For that I do suspect the lusty Moor</p>
<p> Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof</p>
<p> Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards,</p>
<p> And nothing can or shall content my soul</p>
<p> Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife.</p>
<p> Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor</p>
<p> At least into a jealousy so strong</p>
<p> That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,</p>
<p> If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace</p>
<p> For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,</p>
<p> I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,</p>
<p> Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb</p>
<p> (For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),</p>
<p> Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me</p>
<p> For making him egregiously an ass</p>
<p> And practicing upon his peace and quiet</p>
<p> Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:</p>
<p> Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.          Exit.</p>
<p> SCENE II.</p>
<p> A street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter a Herald with a proclamation; people following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> HERALD. It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,</p>
<p> that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere</p>
<p> perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into</p>
<p> triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what</p>
<p> sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these</p>
<p> beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much</p>
<p> was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and</p>
<p> there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five</p>
<p> till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus</p>
<p> and our noble general Othello!                       Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE III.</p>
<p> A hall in the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.</p>
<p> Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop,</p>
<p> Not to outsport discretion.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Iago hath direction what to do;</p>
<p> But notwithstanding with my personal eye</p>
<p> Will I look to't.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Iago is most honest.</p>
<p> Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest</p>
<p> Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,</p>
<p> The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;</p>
<p> That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.</p>
<p> Good night.</p>
<p> Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CASSIO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.</p>
<p> IAGO. Not this hour, lieutenant, 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our</p>
<p> general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let</p>
<p> us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night</p>
<p> with her, and she is sport for Jove.</p>
<p> CASSIO. She's a most exquisite lady.</p>
<p> IAGO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.</p>
<p> IAGO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to</p>
<p> provocation.</p>
<p> CASSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.</p>
<p> IAGO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?</p>
<p> CASSIO. She is indeed perfection.</p>
<p> IAGO. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a</p>
<p> stope of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants</p>
<p> that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains</p>
<p> for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other</p>
<p> custom of entertainment.</p>
<p> IAGO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily</p>
<p> qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am</p>
<p> unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with</p>
<p> any more.</p>
<p> IAGO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Where are they?</p>
<p> IAGO. Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                   Exit.</p>
<p> IAGO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,</p>
<p> With that which he hath drunk tonight already,</p>
<p> He'll be as full of quarrel and offense</p>
<p> As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,</p>
<p> Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,</p>
<p> To Desdemona hath tonight caroused</p>
<p> Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.</p>
<p> Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,</p>
<p> That hold their honors in a wary distance,</p>
<p> The very elements of this warlike isle,</p>
<p> Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,</p>
<p> And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,</p>
<p> Am I to put our Cassio in some action</p>
<p> That may offend the isle. But here they come.</p>
<p> If consequence do but approve my dream,</p>
<p> My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Cassio; with him Montano and Gentlemen;</p>
<p> Servants following with wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CASSIO. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.</p>
<p> MONTANO. Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a</p>
<p> soldier.</p>
<p> IAGO. Some wine, ho!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [Sings.]   &quot;And let me the canakin clink, clink;</p>
<p> And let me the canakin clink.</p>
<p> A soldier's a man;</p>
<p> O, man's life's but a span;</p>
<p> Why then let a soldier drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some wine, boys!</p>
<p> CASSIO. 'Fore God, an excellent song.</p>
<p> IAGO. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in</p>
<p> potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander-</p>
<p> Drink, ho!- are nothing to your English.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he</p>
<p> sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a</p>
<p> vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.</p>
<p> CASSIO. To the health of our general!</p>
<p> MONTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.</p>
<p> IAGO. O sweet England!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [Sings.]   &quot;King Stephen was and-a worthy peer,</p>
<p> His breeches cost him but a crown;</p>
<p> He held them sixpence all too dear,</p>
<p> With that he call'd the tailor lown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;He was a wight of high renown,</p>
<p> And thou art but of low degree.</p>
<p> 'Tis pride that pulls the country down;</p>
<p> Then take thine auld cloak about thee.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some wine, ho!</p>
<p> CASSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.</p>
<p> IAGO. Will you hear't again?</p>
<p> CASSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does</p>
<p> those things. Well, God's above all, and there be souls must be</p>
<p> saved, and there be souls must not be saved.</p>
<p> IAGO. It's true, good lieutenant.</p>
<p> CASSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man</p>
<p> of quality- I hope to be saved.</p>
<p> IAGO. And so do I too, lieutenant.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to</p>
<p> be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to</p>
<p> our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to</p>
<p> our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my</p>
<p> ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not</p>
<p> drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.</p>
<p> ALL. Excellent well.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am</p>
<p> drunk.                                                 Exit.</p>
<p> MONTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.</p>
<p> IAGO. You see this fellow that is gone before;</p>
<p> He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar</p>
<p> And give direction. And do but see his vice;</p>
<p> 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,</p>
<p> The one as long as the other. 'Tis pity of him.</p>
<p> I fear the trust Othello puts him in</p>
<p> On some odd time of his infirmity</p>
<p> Will shake this island.</p>
<p> MONTANO. But is he often thus?</p>
<p> IAGO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.</p>
<p> He'll watch the horologe a double set,</p>
<p> If drink rock not his cradle.</p>
<p> MONTANO. It were well</p>
<p> The general were put in mind of it.</p>
<p> Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature</p>
<p> Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio</p>
<p> And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Roderigo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!</p>
<p> I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.         Exit Roderigo.</p>
<p> MONTANO. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor</p>
<p> Should hazard such a place as his own second</p>
<p> With one of an ingraft infirmity.</p>
<p> It were an honest action to say</p>
<p> So to the Moor.</p>
<p> IAGO. Not 1, for this fair island.</p>
<p> I do love Cassio well, and would do much</p>
<p> To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?</p>
<p> A cry within, &quot;Help, help!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CASSIO. 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!</p>
<p> MONTANO. What's the matter, lieutenant?</p>
<p> CASSIO. A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a</p>
<p> twiggen bottle.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Beat me!</p>
<p> CASSIO. Dost thou prate, rogue?              Strikes Roderigo.</p>
<p> MONTANO. Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.</p>
<p> MONTANO. Come, come, you're drunk.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Drunk?                                     They fight.</p>
<p> IAGO. [Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say; go out and cry mutiny.</p>
<p> Exit Roderigo.</p>
<p> Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!</p>
<p> Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir-</p>
<p> Help, masters!- Here's a goodly watch indeed!</p>
<p> A bell rings.</p>
<p> Who's that that rings the bell?- Diablo, ho!</p>
<p> The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!</p>
<p> You will be shamed forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Othello and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What is the matter here?</p>
<p> MONTANO. 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.</p>
<p> Faints.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Hold, for your lives!</p>
<p> IAGO. Hold, ho! Lieutenant- sir- Montano- gentlemen-</p>
<p> Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?</p>
<p> Hold! the general speaks to you! Hold, hold, for shame!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?</p>
<p> Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that</p>
<p> Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?</p>
<p> For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl.</p>
<p> He that stirs next to carve for his own rage</p>
<p> Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.</p>
<p> Silence that dreadful bell; it frights the isle</p>
<p> From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?</p>
<p> Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,</p>
<p> Speak: who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.</p>
<p> IAGO. I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,</p>
<p> In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom</p>
<p> Devesting them for bed; and then, but now</p>
<p> (As if some planet had unwitted men),</p>
<p> Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,</p>
<p> In opposition bloody. I cannot speak</p>
<p> Any beginning to this peevish odds;</p>
<p> And would in action glorious I had lost</p>
<p> Those legs that brought me to a part of it!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. How come sit, Michael, you are thus forgot?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;</p>
<p> The gravity and stillness of your youth</p>
<p> The world hath noted, and your name is great</p>
<p> In mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter,</p>
<p> That you unlace your reputation thus,</p>
<p> And spend your rich opinion for the name</p>
<p> Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.</p>
<p> MONTANO. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.</p>
<p> Your officer, Iago, can inform you-</p>
<p> While I spare speech, which something now offends me-</p>
<p> Of all that I do know. Nor know I aught</p>
<p> By me that's said or done amiss this night,</p>
<p> Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,</p>
<p> And to defend ourselves it be a sin</p>
<p> When violence assails us.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Now, by heaven,</p>
<p> My blood begins my safer guides to rule,</p>
<p> And passion, having my best judgement collied,</p>
<p> Assays to lead the way. If I once stir,</p>
<p> Or do but lift this arni, the best of you</p>
<p> Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know</p>
<p> How this foul rout began, who set it on,</p>
<p> And he that is approved in this offense,</p>
<p> Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,</p>
<p> Shall lose me What! in a town of war,</p>
<p> Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,</p>
<p> To manage private and domestic quarrel,</p>
<p> In night, and on the court and guard of safety!</p>
<p> 'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?</p>
<p> MONTANO. If partially affined, or leagued in office,</p>
<p> Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,</p>
<p> Thou art no soldier.</p>
<p> IAGO. Touch me not so near:</p>
<p> I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</p>
<p> Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio;</p>
<p> Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth</p>
<p> Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.</p>
<p> Montano and myself being in speech,</p>
<p> There comes a fellow crying out for help,</p>
<p> And Cassio following him with determined sword,</p>
<p> To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</p>
<p> Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.</p>
<p> Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</p>
<p> Lest by his clamor- as it so fell out-</p>
<p> The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,</p>
<p> Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather</p>
<p> For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</p>
<p> And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight</p>
<p> I ne'er might say before. When I came back-</p>
<p> For this was brief- I found them close together,</p>
<p> At blow and thrust, even as again they were</p>
<p> When you yourself did part them.</p>
<p> More of this matter cannot I report.</p>
<p> But men are men. the best sometimes forget.</p>
<p> Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</p>
<p> As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</p>
<p> Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</p>
<p> From him that fled some strange indignity,</p>
<p> Which patience could not pass.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I know, Iago,</p>
<p> Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,</p>
<p> Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,</p>
<p> But never more be officer of mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Desdemona, attended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!</p>
<p> I'll make thee an example.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. What's the matter?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.</p>
<p> Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.</p>
<p> Lead him off.                        Exit Montano, attended.</p>
<p> Iago, look with care about the town,</p>
<p> And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.</p>
<p> Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.</p>
<p> To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.</p>
<p> Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio.</p>
<p> IAGO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Ay, past all surgery.</p>
<p> IAGO. Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p> CASSIO. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my</p>
<p> reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what</p>
<p> remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!</p>
<p> IAGO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily</p>
<p> wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation</p>
<p> is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and</p>
<p> lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all,</p>
<p> unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are</p>
<p> ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his</p>
<p> mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one</p>
<p> would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue</p>
<p> to him again, and he's yours.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a</p>
<p> commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an</p>
<p> officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear?</p>
<p> and discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible</p>
<p> spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call</p>
<p> thee devil!</p>
<p> IAGO. What was he that you followed with your sword?</p>
<p> What had he done to you?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I know not.</p>
<p> IAGO. Is't possible?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a</p>
<p> quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an</p>
<p> enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should,</p>
<p> with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves</p>
<p> into beasts!</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus</p>
<p> recovered?</p>
<p> CASSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the</p>
<p> devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me</p>
<p> frankly despise myself.</p>
<p> IAGO. Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place,</p>
<p> and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish</p>
<p> this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your</p>
<p> own good.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a</p>
<p> drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would</p>
<p> stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and</p>
<p> presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblest,</p>
<p> and the ingredient is a devil.</p>
<p> IAGO. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be</p>
<p> well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I</p>
<p> think you think I love you.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!</p>
<p> IAGO. You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'll</p>
<p> tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the</p>
<p> general. I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted</p>
<p> and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement</p>
<p> of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her;</p>
<p> importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so</p>
<p> free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a</p>
<p> vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This</p>
<p> broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter;</p>
<p> and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your</p>
<p> love shall grow stronger than it was before.</p>
<p> CASSIO. You advise me well.</p>
<p> IAGO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will</p>
<p> beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am</p>
<p> desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.</p>
<p> IAGO. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the</p>
<p> watch.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Good night, honest Iago.                         Exit.</p>
<p> IAGO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?</p>
<p> When this advice is free I give and honest,</p>
<p> Probal to thinking, and indeed the course</p>
<p> To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy</p>
<p> The inclining Desdemona to subdue</p>
<p> In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful</p>
<p> As the free elements. And then for her</p>
<p> To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,</p>
<p> All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,</p>
<p> His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,</p>
<p> That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</p>
<p> Even as her appetite shall play the god</p>
<p> With his weak function. How am I then a villain</p>
<p> To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,</p>
<p> Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</p>
<p> When devils will the blackest sins put on,</p>
<p> They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</p>
<p> As I do now. For whiles this honest fool</p>
<p> Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,</p>
<p> And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</p>
<p> I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,</p>
<p> That she repeals him for her body's lust;</p>
<p> And by how much she strives to do him good,</p>
<p> She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</p>
<p> So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</p>
<p> And out of her own goodness make the net</p>
<p> That shall enmesh them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Roderigo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> How now, Roderigo!</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that</p>
<p> hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I</p>
<p> have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled; and I think the</p>
<p> issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and</p>
<p> so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to</p>
<p> Venice.</p>
<p> IAGO. How poor are they that have not patience!</p>
<p> What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</p>
<p> Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,</p>
<p> And wit depends on dilatory time.</p>
<p> Doest not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,</p>
<p> And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.</p>
<p> Though other things grow fair against the sun,</p>
<p> Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.</p>
<p> Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;</p>
<p> Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</p>
<p> Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.</p>
<p> Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.</p>
<p> Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:</p>
<p> My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-</p>
<p> I'll set her on;</p>
<p> Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,</p>
<p> And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</p>
<p> Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;</p>
<p> Dull not device by coldness and delay.                 Exit.</p>
<p> ACT III. SCENE I.</p>
<p> Before the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Cassio and some Musicians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CASSIO. Masters, play here, I will content your pains; Something</p>
<p> that's brief; and bid &quot;Good morrow, general.&quot;</p>
<p> Music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Clown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CLOWN. Why, masters, have your instruments been in</p>
<p> Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus?</p>
<p> FIRST MUSICIAN. How, sir, how?</p>
<p> CLOWN. Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?</p>
<p> FIRST MUSICIAN. Ay, marry, are they, sir.</p>
<p> CLOWN. O thereby hangs a tail.</p>
<p> FIRST MUSICIAN. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?</p>
<p> CLOWN. Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But,</p>
<p> masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your</p>
<p> music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more</p>
<p> noise with it.</p>
<p> FIRST MUSICIAN. Well, sir, we will not.</p>
<p> CLOWN. If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again;</p>
<p> but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly</p>
<p> care.</p>
<p> FIRST MUSICIAN. We have none such, sir.</p>
<p> CLOWN. Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away.</p>
<p> Go, vanish into air, away!                 Exeunt Musicians.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Dost thou hear, my honest friend?</p>
<p> CLOWN. No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold</p>
<p> for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be</p>
<p> stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor</p>
<p> of speech. Wilt thou do this?</p>
<p> CLOWN. She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem</p>
<p> to notify unto her.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Do, good my friend.                        Exit Clown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In happy time, Iago.</p>
<p> IAGO. You have not been abed, then?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Why, no; the day had broke</p>
<p> Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,</p>
<p> To send in to your wife. My suit to her</p>
<p> Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona</p>
<p> Procure me some access.</p>
<p> IAGO. I'll send her to you presently;</p>
<p> And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor</p>
<p> Out of the way, that your converse and business</p>
<p> May be more free.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I humbly thank you for't. [Exit Iago.] I never knew</p>
<p> A Florentine more kind and honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> EMILIA. Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry</p>
<p> For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.</p>
<p> The general and his wife are talking of it,</p>
<p> And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies</p>
<p> That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus</p>
<p> And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom</p>
<p> He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you</p>
<p> And needs no other suitor but his likings</p>
<p> To take the safest occasion by the front</p>
<p> To bring you in again.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Yet, I beseech you,</p>
<p> If you think fit, or that it may be done,</p>
<p> Give me advantage of some brief discourse</p>
<p> With Desdemona alone.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Pray you, come in.</p>
<p> I will bestow you where you shall have time</p>
<p> To speak your bosom freely.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I am much bound to you.</p>
<p> Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE II.</p>
<p> A room in the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,</p>
<p> And by him do my duties to the Senate.</p>
<p> That done, I will be walking on the works;</p>
<p> Repair there to me.</p>
<p> IAGO. Well, my good lord, I'll do't.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?</p>
<p> GENTLEMEN. We'll wait upon your lordship.              Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE III.</p>
<p> The garden of the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do</p>
<p> All my abilities in thy behalf.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband</p>
<p> As if the cause were his.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,</p>
<p> But I will have my lord and you again</p>
<p> As friendly as you were.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Bounteous madam,</p>
<p> Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,</p>
<p> He's never anything but your true servant.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I know't: I thank you. You do love my lord:</p>
<p> You have known him long; and be you well assured</p>
<p> He shall in strangeness stand no farther off</p>
<p> Than in a politic distance.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Ay, but, lady,</p>
<p> That policy may either last so long,</p>
<p> Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</p>
<p> Or breed itself so out of circumstances,</p>
<p> That I being absent and my place supplied,</p>
<p> My general will forget my love and service.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here</p>
<p> I give thee warrant of thy place, assure thee,</p>
<p> If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it</p>
<p> To the last article. My lord shall never rest;</p>
<p> I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;</p>
<p> His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;</p>
<p> I'll intermingle everything he does</p>
<p> With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,</p>
<p> For thy solicitor shall rather die</p>
<p> Than give thy cause away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello and Iago, at a distance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> EMILIA. Madam, here comes my lord.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Madam, I'll take my leave.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Nay, stay and hear me speak.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,</p>
<p> Unfit for mine own purposes.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Well, do your discretion.              Exit Cassio.</p>
<p> IAGO. Ha! I like not that.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What dost thou say?</p>
<p> IAGO. Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</p>
<p> IAGO. Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,</p>
<p> That he would steal away so guilty-like,</p>
<p> Seeing you coming.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I do believe 'twas he.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. How now, my lord!</p>
<p> I have been talking with a suitor here,</p>
<p> A man that languishes in your displeasure.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Who is't you mean?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</p>
<p> If I have any grace or power to move you,</p>
<p> His present reconciliation take;</p>
<p> For if he be not one that truly loves you,</p>
<p> That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</p>
<p> I have no judgement in an honest face.</p>
<p> I prithee, call him back.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Went he hence now?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Ay, sooth; so humbled</p>
<p> That he hath left part of his grief with me</p>
<p> To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. But shall't be shortly?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The sooner, sweet, for you.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Shall't be tonight at supper?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. No, not tonight.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Tomorrow dinner then?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I shall not dine at home;</p>
<p> I meet the captains at the citadel.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,</p>
<p> On Tuesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn.</p>
<p> I prithee, name the time, but let it not</p>
<p> Exceed three days. In faith, he's penitent;</p>
<p> And yet his trespass, in our common reason-</p>
<p> Save that, they say, the wars must make example</p>
<p> Out of their best- is not almost a fault</p>
<p> To incur a private check. When shall he come?</p>
<p> Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul,</p>
<p> What you would ask me, that I should deny,</p>
<p> Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,</p>
<p> That came awooing with you, and so many a time</p>
<p> When I have spoke of you dispraisingly</p>
<p> Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do</p>
<p> To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;</p>
<p> I will deny thee nothing.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why, this is not a boon;</p>
<p> 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</p>
<p> Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</p>
<p> Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</p>
<p> To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit</p>
<p> Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</p>
<p> It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,</p>
<p> And fearful to be granted.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I will deny thee nothing,</p>
<p> Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</p>
<p> To leave me but a little to myself.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Emilia, come. Be as your fanciest each you;</p>
<p> Whate'er you be, I am obedient.</p>
<p> Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,</p>
<p> But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,</p>
<p> Chaos is come again.</p>
<p> IAGO. My noble lord-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What dost thou say, Iago?</p>
<p> IAGO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,</p>
<p> Know of your love?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?</p>
<p> IAGO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;</p>
<p> No further harm.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why of thy thought, Iago?</p>
<p> IAGO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.</p>
<p> IAGO. Indeed!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discernist thou aught in that?</p>
<p> Is he not honest?</p>
<p> IAGO. Honest, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Honest? Ay, honest.</p>
<p> IAGO. My lord, for aught I know.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What dost thou think?</p>
<p> IAGO. Think, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,</p>
<p> As if there were some monster in his thought</p>
<p> Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.</p>
<p> I heard thee say even now, thou likest not that,</p>
<p> When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?</p>
<p> And when I told thee he was of my counsel</p>
<p> In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, &quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>
<p> And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</p>
<p> As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</p>
<p> Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,</p>
<p> Show me thy thought.</p>
<p> IAGO. My lord, you know I love you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I think thou dost;</p>
<p> And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty</p>
<p> And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</p>
<p> Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;</p>
<p> For such things in a false disloyal knave</p>
<p> Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just</p>
<p> They're close dilations, working from the heart,</p>
<p> That passion cannot rule.</p>
<p> IAGO. For Michael Cassio,</p>
<p> I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I think so too.</p>
<p> IAGO. Men should be what they seem;</p>
<p> Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.</p>
<p> IAGO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.</p>
<p> I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</p>
<p> As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</p>
<p> The worst of words.</p>
<p> IAGO. Good my lord, pardon me;</p>
<p> Though I am bound to every act of duty,</p>
<p> I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</p>
<p> Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;</p>
<p> As where's that palace whereinto foul things</p>
<p> Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure,</p>
<p> But some uncleanly apprehensions</p>
<p> Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit</p>
<p> With meditations lawful?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</p>
<p> If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear</p>
<p> A stranger to thy thoughts.</p>
<p> IAGO. I do beseech you-</p>
<p> Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</p>
<p> As, I confess, it is my nature's plague</p>
<p> To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</p>
<p> Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet,</p>
<p> From one that so imperfectly conceits,</p>
<p> Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</p>
<p> Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</p>
<p> It mere not for your quiet nor your good,</p>
<p> Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,</p>
<p> To let you know my thoughts.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What dost thou mean?</p>
<p> IAGO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</p>
<p> Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</p>
<p> Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;</p>
<p> 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;</p>
<p> But he that filches from me my good name</p>
<p> Robs me of that which not enriches him</p>
<p> And makes me poor indeed.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.</p>
<p> IAGO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;</p>
<p> Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ha!</p>
<p> IAGO. O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!</p>
<p> It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock</p>
<p> The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</p>
<p> Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</p>
<p> But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er</p>
<p> Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O misery!</p>
<p> IAGO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;</p>
<p> But riches fineless is as poor as winter</p>
<p> To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</p>
<p> Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</p>
<p> From jealousy!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why, why is this?</p>
<p> Think'st thou lid make a life of jealousy,</p>
<p> To follow still the changes of the moon</p>
<p> With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt</p>
<p> Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat</p>
<p> When I shall turn the business of my soul</p>
<p> To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</p>
<p> Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous</p>
<p> To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</p>
<p> Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</p>
<p> Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</p>
<p> Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</p>
<p> The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;</p>
<p> For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago,</p>
<p> I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</p>
<p> And on the proof, there is no more but this-</p>
<p> Away at once with love or jealousy!</p>
<p> IAGO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason</p>
<p> To show the love and duty that I bear you</p>
<p> With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,</p>
<p> Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</p>
<p> Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</p>
<p> Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.</p>
<p> I would not have your free and noble nature</p>
<p> Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to't.</p>
<p> I know our country disposition well;</p>
<p> In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</p>
<p> They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</p>
<p> Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Dost thou say so?</p>
<p> IAGO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;</p>
<p> And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,</p>
<p> She loved them most.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. And so she did.</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, go to then.</p>
<p> She that so young could give out such a seeming,</p>
<p> To seel her father's eyes up close as oak-</p>
<p> He thought 'twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame;</p>
<p> I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</p>
<p> For too much loving you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I am bound to thee forever.</p>
<p> IAGO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.</p>
<p> IAGO. I'faith, I fear it has.</p>
<p> I hope you will consider what is spoke</p>
<p> Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved;</p>
<p> I am to pray you not to strain my speech</p>
<p> To grosser issues nor to larger reach</p>
<p> Than to suspicion.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I will not.</p>
<p> IAGO. Should you do so, my lord,</p>
<p> My speech should fall into such vile success</p>
<p> Which my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-</p>
<p> My lord, I see you're moved.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. No, not much moved.</p>
<p> I do not think but Desdemona's honest.</p>
<p> IAGO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-</p>
<p> IAGO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-</p>
<p> Not to affect many proposed matches</p>
<p> Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</p>
<p> Whereto we see in all things nature tends-</p>
<p> Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank,</p>
<p> Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.</p>
<p> But pardon me. I do not in position</p>
<p> Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear,</p>
<p> Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,</p>
<p> May fall to match you with her country forms,</p>
<p> And happily repent.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Farewell, farewell.</p>
<p> If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;</p>
<p> Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.</p>
<p> IAGO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless</p>
<p> Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</p>
<p> IAGO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor</p>
<p> To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.</p>
<p> Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,</p>
<p> For sure he fills it up with great ability,</p>
<p> Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,</p>
<p> You shall by that perceive him and his means.</p>
<p> Note if your lady strain his entertainment</p>
<p> With any strong or vehement importunity;</p>
<p> Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,</p>
<p> Let me be thought too busy in my fears-</p>
<p> As worthy cause I have to fear I am-</p>
<p> And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Fear not my government.</p>
<p> IAGO. I once more take my leave.                         Exit.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,</p>
<p> And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,</p>
<p> Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,</p>
<p> Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,</p>
<p> I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind</p>
<p> To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black</p>
<p> And have not those soft parts of conversation</p>
<p> That chamberers have, or for I am declined</p>
<p> Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-</p>
<p> She's gone. I am abused, and my relief</p>
<p> Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,</p>
<p> That we can call these delicate creatures ours,</p>
<p> And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,</p>
<p> And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,</p>
<p> Than keep a corner in the thing I love</p>
<p> For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:</p>
<p> Prerogatived are they less than the base;</p>
<p> 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.</p>
<p> Even then this forked plague is fated to us</p>
<p> When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Desdemona and Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!</p>
<p> I'll not believe't.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. How now, my dear Othello!</p>
<p> Your dinner, and the generous islanders</p>
<p> By you invited, do attend your presence.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I am to blame.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why do you speak so faintly?</p>
<p> Are you not well?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.</p>
<p> Let me but bind it hard, within this hour</p>
<p> It will be well.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Your napkin is too little;</p>
<p> He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it.</p>
<p> Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.</p>
<p> Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;</p>
<p> This was her first remembrance from the Moor.</p>
<p> My wayward husband hath a hundred times</p>
<p> Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,</p>
<p> For he conjured her she should ever keep it,</p>
<p> That she reserves it evermore about her</p>
<p> To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,</p>
<p> And give't Iago. What he will do with it</p>
<p> Heaven knows, not I;</p>
<p> I nothing but to please his fantasy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. How now, what do you here alone?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.</p>
<p> IAGO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-</p>
<p> EMILIA. Ha!</p>
<p> IAGO. To have a foolish wife.</p>
<p> EMILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now</p>
<p> For that same handkerchief?</p>
<p> IAGO. What handkerchief?</p>
<p> EMILIA. What handkerchief?</p>
<p> Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,</p>
<p> That which so often you did bid me steal.</p>
<p> IAGO. Hast stol'n it from her?</p>
<p> EMILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,</p>
<p> And, to the advantage, I being here took't up.</p>
<p> Look, here it is.</p>
<p> IAGO. A good wench; give it me.</p>
<p> EMILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest</p>
<p> To have me filch it?</p>
<p> IAGO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?</p>
<p> EMILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,</p>
<p> Give't me again. Poor lady, she'll run mad</p>
<p> When she shall lack it.</p>
<p> IAGO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.</p>
<p> Go, leave me.                                   Exit Emilia.</p>
<p> I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,</p>
<p> And let him find it. Trifles light as air</p>
<p> Are to the jealous confirmations strong</p>
<p> As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.</p>
<p> The Moor already changes with my poison:</p>
<p> Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,</p>
<p> Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</p>
<p> But with a little act upon the blood</p>
<p> Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.</p>
<p> Look, where he comes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Othello.</p>
<p> Not poppy, nor mandragora,</p>
<p> Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,</p>
<p> Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</p>
<p> Which thou owedst yesterday.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ha, ha, false to me?</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.</p>
<p> I swear 'tis better to be much abused</p>
<p> Than but to know't a little.</p>
<p> IAGO. How now, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?</p>
<p> I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me;</p>
<p> I slept the next night well, was free and merry;</p>
<p> I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips.</p>
<p> He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,</p>
<p> Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.</p>
<p> IAGO. I am sorry to hear this.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,</p>
<p> Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,</p>
<p> So I had nothing known. O, now forever</p>
<p> Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!</p>
<p> Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars</p>
<p> That make ambition virtue! O, farewell,</p>
<p> Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,</p>
<p> The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,</p>
<p> The royal banner, and all quality,</p>
<p> Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</p>
<p> And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats</p>
<p> The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit,</p>
<p> Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!</p>
<p> IAGO. Is't possible, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;</p>
<p> Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof;</p>
<p> Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,</p>
<p> Thou hadst been better have been born a dog</p>
<p> Than answer my waked wrath!</p>
<p> IAGO. Is't come to this?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,</p>
<p> That the probation bear no hinge nor loop</p>
<p> To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!</p>
<p> IAGO. My noble lord-</p>
<p> OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me,</p>
<p> Never pray more; abandon all remorse;</p>
<p> On horror's head horrors accumulate;</p>
<p> Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;</p>
<p> For nothing canst thou to damnation add</p>
<p> Greater than that.</p>
<p> IAGO. O grace! O heaven defend me!</p>
<p> Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?</p>
<p> God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool,</p>
<p> That livest to make thine honesty a vice!</p>
<p> O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,</p>
<p> To be direct and honest is not safe.</p>
<p> I thank you for this profit, and from hence</p>
<p> I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.</p>
<p> IAGO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,</p>
<p> And loses that it works for.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. By the world,</p>
<p> I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;</p>
<p> I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.</p>
<p> I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh</p>
<p> As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black</p>
<p> As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,</p>
<p> Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,</p>
<p> I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</p>
<p> IAGO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;</p>
<p> I do repent me that I put it to you.</p>
<p> You would be satisfied?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Would? Nay, I will.</p>
<p> IAGO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?</p>
<p> Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?</p>
<p> Behold her topp'd?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Death and damnation! O!</p>
<p> IAGO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</p>
<p> To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,</p>
<p> If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster</p>
<p> More than their own! What then? how then?</p>
<p> What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?</p>
<p> It is impossible you should see this</p>
<p> Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</p>
<p> As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</p>
<p> As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,</p>
<p> If imputation and strong circumstances,</p>
<p> Which lead directly to the door of truth,</p>
<p> Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.</p>
<p> IAGO. I do not like the office;</p>
<p> But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,</p>
<p> Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,</p>
<p> I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately</p>
<p> And, being troubled with a raging tooth,</p>
<p> I could not sleep.</p>
<p> There are a kind of men so loose of soul,</p>
<p> That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;</p>
<p> One of this kind is Cassio.</p>
<p> In sleep I heard him say, &quot;Sweet Desdemona,</p>
<p> Let us be wary, let us hide our loves&quot;;</p>
<p> And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</p>
<p> Cry, &quot;O sweet creature!&quot; and then kiss me hard,</p>
<p> As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,</p>
<p> That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg</p>
<p> Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kiss'd; and then</p>
<p> Cried, &quot;Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!</p>
<p> IAGO. Nay, this was but his dream.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p> 'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</p>
<p> IAGO. And this may help to thicken other proofs</p>
<p> That do demonstrate thinly.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I'll tear her all to pieces.</p>
<p> IAGO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;</p>
<p> She may be honest yet. Tell me but this;</p>
<p> Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</p>
<p> Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.</p>
<p> IAGO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-</p>
<p> I am sure it was your wife's- did I today</p>
<p> See Cassio wipe his beard with.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. If it be that-</p>
<p> IAGO. If it be that, or any that was hers,</p>
<p> It speaks against her with the other proofs.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!</p>
<p> One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</p>
<p> Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago,</p>
<p> All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</p>
<p> 'Tis gone.</p>
<p> Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!</p>
<p> Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</p>
<p> To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,</p>
<p> For 'tis of aspics' tongues!</p>
<p> IAGO. Yet be content.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!</p>
<p> IAGO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,</p>
<p> Whose icy current and compulsive course</p>
<p> Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</p>
<p> To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</p>
<p> Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</p>
<p> Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,</p>
<p> Till that a capable and wide revenge</p>
<p> Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,</p>
<p> In the due reverence of a sacred vow                 Kneels.</p>
<p> I here engage my words.</p>
<p> IAGO. Do not rise yet.                                 Kneels.</p>
<p> Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</p>
<p> You elements that clip us round about,</p>
<p> Witness that here Iago doth give up</p>
<p> The execution of his wit, hands, heart,</p>
<p> To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,</p>
<p> And to obey shall be in me remorse,</p>
<p> What bloody business ever.                        They rise.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I greet thy love,</p>
<p> Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,</p>
<p> And will upon the instant put thee to't:</p>
<p> Within these three days let me hear thee say</p>
<p> That Cassio's not alive.</p>
<p> IAGO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;</p>
<p> But let her live.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!</p>
<p> Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,</p>
<p> To furnish me with some swift means of death</p>
<p> For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</p>
<p> IAGO. I am your own forever.                           Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE IV.</p>
<p> Before the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</p>
<p> CLOWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why, man?</p>
<p> CLOWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is</p>
<p> stabbing.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?</p>
<p> CLOWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?</p>
<p> CLOWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise lodging,</p>
<p> and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own</p>
<p> throat.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?</p>
<p> CLOWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions</p>
<p> and by them answer.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my</p>
<p> lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.</p>
<p> CLOWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore</p>
<p> I will attempt the doing it.                           Exit.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?</p>
<p> EMILIA. I know not, madam.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</p>
<p> Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor</p>
<p> Is true of mind and made of no such baseness</p>
<p> As jealous creatures are, it were enough</p>
<p> To put him to ill thinking.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Is he not jealous?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</p>
<p> Drew all such humors from him.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Look, where he comes.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio</p>
<p> Be call'd to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> How is't with you, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!</p>
<p> How do you, Desdemona?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Well, my good lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;</p>
<p> Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires</p>
<p> A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,</p>
<p> Much castigation, exercise devout,</p>
<p> For here's a young and sweating devil here</p>
<p> That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,</p>
<p> A frank one.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;</p>
<p> For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;</p>
<p> But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What promise, chuck?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;</p>
<p> Lend me thy handkerchief.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Here, my lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That which I gave you.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I have it not about me.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Not?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief</p>
<p> Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</p>
<p> She was a charmer, and could almost read</p>
<p> The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,</p>
<p> 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</p>
<p> Entirely to her love, but if she lost it</p>
<p> Or made a gift of it, my father's eye</p>
<p> Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt</p>
<p> After new fancies. She dying gave it me,</p>
<p> And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,</p>
<p> To give it her. I did so, and take heed on't;</p>
<p> Make it a darling like your precious eye;</p>
<p> To lose't or give't away were such perdition</p>
<p> As nothing else could match.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Is't possible?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.</p>
<p> A sibyl, that had number'd in the world</p>
<p> The sun to course two hundred compasses,</p>
<p> In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;</p>
<p> The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,</p>
<p> And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful</p>
<p> Conserved of maiden's hearts.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Indeed! is't true?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ha! wherefore?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Heaven bless us!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Say you?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. How?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.</p>
<p> This is a trick to put me from my suit.</p>
<p> Pray you, let Cassio be received again.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Come, come,</p>
<p> You'll never meet a more sufficient man.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The handkerchief!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I pray, talk me of Cassio.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The handkerchief!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. A man that all his time</p>
<p> Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,</p>
<p> Shared dangers with you-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The handkerchief!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Away!                                           Exit.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Is not this man jealous?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.</p>
<p> Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief;</p>
<p> I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</p>
<p> EMILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.</p>
<p> They are all but stomachs and we all but food;</p>
<p> They eat us hungerly, and when they are full</p>
<p> They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Cassio and Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.</p>
<p> And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you</p>
<p> That by your virtuous means I may again</p>
<p> Exist and be a member of his love</p>
<p> Whom I with all the office of my heart</p>
<p> Entirely honor. I would not be delay'd.</p>
<p> If my offense be of such mortal kind</p>
<p> That nor my service past nor present sorrows</p>
<p> Nor purposed merit in futurity</p>
<p> Can ransom me into his love again,</p>
<p> But to know so must be my benefit;</p>
<p> So shall I clothe me in a forced content</p>
<p> And shut myself up in some other course</p>
<p> To Fortune's alms.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!</p>
<p> My advocation is not now in tune;</p>
<p> My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him</p>
<p> Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.</p>
<p> So help me every spirit sanctified,</p>
<p> As I have spoken for you all my best</p>
<p> And stood within the blank of his displeasure</p>
<p> For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.</p>
<p> What I can do I will; and more I will</p>
<p> Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.</p>
<p> IAGO. Is my lord angry?</p>
<p> EMILIA. He went hence but now,</p>
<p> And certainly in strange unquietness.</p>
<p> IAGO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,</p>
<p> When it hath blown his ranks into the air</p>
<p> And, like the devil, from his very arm</p>
<p> Puff'd his own brother. And can he be angry?</p>
<p> Something of moment then. I will go meet him.</p>
<p> There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA I prithee, do so.                         Exit Iago.</p>
<p> Something sure of state,</p>
<p> Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice</p>
<p> Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</p>
<p> Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases</p>
<p> Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,</p>
<p> Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;</p>
<p> For let our finger ache, and it indues</p>
<p> Our other healthful members even to that sense</p>
<p> Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,</p>
<p> Nor of them look for such observancy</p>
<p> As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</p>
<p> I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,</p>
<p> Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;</p>
<p> But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,</p>
<p> And he's indicted falsely.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,</p>
<p> And no conception nor no jealous toy</p>
<p> Concerning you.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause!</p>
<p> EMILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;</p>
<p> They are not ever jealous for the cause,</p>
<p> But jealous for they are jealous. 'Tis a monster</p>
<p> Begot upon itself, born on itself.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!</p>
<p> EMILIA. Lady, amen.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk here about.</p>
<p> If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit,</p>
<p> And seek to effect it to my uttermost.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I humbly thank your ladyship.</p>
<p> Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Bianca.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> BIANCA. Save you, friend Cassio!</p>
<p> CASSIO. What make you from, home?</p>
<p> How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?</p>
<p> I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</p>
<p> BIANCA. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.</p>
<p> What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?</p>
<p> Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,</p>
<p> More tedious than the dial eight score times?</p>
<p> O weary reckoning!</p>
<p> CASSIO. Pardon me, Bianca.</p>
<p> I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd;</p>
<p> But I shall in a more continuate time</p>
<p> Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,</p>
<p> Gives her Desdemona's handkerchief.</p>
<p> Take me this work out.</p>
<p> BIANCA. O Cassio, whence came this?</p>
<p> This is some token from a newer friend.</p>
<p> To the felt absence now I feel a cause.</p>
<p> Is't come to this? Well, well.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Go to, woman!</p>
<p> Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,</p>
<p> From whence you have them. You are jealous now</p>
<p> That this is from some mistress, some remembrance.</p>
<p> No, by my faith, Bianca.</p>
<p> BIANCA. Why, whose is it?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.</p>
<p> I like the work well. Ere it be demanded-</p>
<p> As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.</p>
<p> Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.</p>
<p> BIANCA. Leave you! wherefore?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I do attend here on the general;</p>
<p> And think it no addition, nor my wish,</p>
<p> To have him see me woman'd.</p>
<p> BIANCA. Why, I pray you?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Not that I love you not.</p>
<p> BIANCA. But that you do not love me.</p>
<p> I pray you, bring me on the way a little,</p>
<p> And say if I shall see you soon at night.</p>
<p> CASSIO. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,</p>
<p> For I attend here, but I'll see you soon.</p>
<p> BIANCA. 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.       Exeunt.</p>
<p> ACT IV. SCENE I.</p>
<p> Cyprus. Before the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello and Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. Will you think so?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Think so, Iago?</p>
<p> IAGO. What,</p>
<p> To kiss in private?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. An unauthorized kiss.</p>
<p> IAGO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed</p>
<p> An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!</p>
<p> It is hypocrisy against the devil.</p>
<p> They that mean virtuously and yet do so,</p>
<p> The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.</p>
<p> IAGO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.</p>
<p> But if I give my wife a handkerchief-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What then?</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,</p>
<p> She may, I think, bestow't on any man.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. She is protectress of her honor too.</p>
<p> May she give that?</p>
<p> IAGO. Her honor is an essence that's not seen;</p>
<p> They have it very oft that have it not.</p>
<p> But for the handkerchief-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</p>
<p> Thou said'st- O, it comes o'er my memory,</p>
<p> As doth the raven o'er the infected house,</p>
<p> Boding to all- he had my handkerchief.</p>
<p> IAGO. Ay, what of that?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That's not so good now.</p>
<p> IAGO. What,</p>
<p> If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</p>
<p> Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad,</p>
<p> Who having, by their own importunate suit,</p>
<p> Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</p>
<p> Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</p>
<p> But they must blab-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Hath he said anything?</p>
<p> IAGO. He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,</p>
<p> No more than he'll unswear.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What hath he said?</p>
<p> IAGO. Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What? what?</p>
<p> IAGO. Lie-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. With her?</p>
<p> IAGO. With her, on her, what you will.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they</p>
<p> belie her. Lie with her! 'Zounds, that's fulsome! Handkerchief-</p>
<p> confessions- handkerchief! To confess and be hanged for his labor</p>
<p> -first, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at it.</p>
<p> Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without</p>
<p> some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish!</p>
<p> Noses, ears, and lips. Is't possible? Confess? Handkerchief? O</p>
<p> devil!</p>
<p> Falls in a trance.</p>
<p> IAGO. Work on,</p>
<p> My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,</p>
<p> And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,</p>
<p> All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!</p>
<p> My lord, I say! Othello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Cassio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> How now, Cassio!</p>
<p> CASSIO. What's the matter?</p>
<p> IAGO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.</p>
<p> This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Rub him about the temples.</p>
<p> IAGO. No, forbear;</p>
<p> The lethargy must have his quiet course.</p>
<p> If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by</p>
<p> Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.</p>
<p> Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</p>
<p> He will recover straight. When he is gone,</p>
<p> I would on great occasion speak with you.       Exit Cassio.</p>
<p> How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Dost thou mock me?</p>
<p> IAGO. I mock you? No, by heaven.</p>
<p> Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. A horned man's a monster and a beast.</p>
<p> IAGO. There's many a beast then in a populous city,</p>
<p> And many a civil monster.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Did he confess it?</p>
<p> IAGO. Good sir, be a man;</p>
<p> Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked</p>
<p> May draw with you. There's millions now alive</p>
<p> That nightly lie in those unproper beds</p>
<p> Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.</p>
<p> O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,</p>
<p> To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</p>
<p> And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,</p>
<p> And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.</p>
<p> IAGO. Stand you awhile apart,</p>
<p> Confine yourself but in a patient list.</p>
<p> Whilst you were here overwhelmed with your grief-</p>
<p> A passion most unsuiting such a man-</p>
<p> Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,</p>
<p> And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;</p>
<p> Bade him anon return and here speak with me</p>
<p> The which he promised. Do but encave yourself</p>
<p> And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,</p>
<p> That dwell in every region of his face;</p>
<p> For I will make him tell the tale anew,</p>
<p> Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</p>
<p> He hath and is again to cope your wife.</p>
<p> I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,</p>
<p> Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,</p>
<p> And nothing of a man.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Dost thou hear, Iago?</p>
<p> I will be found most cunning in my patience;</p>
<p> But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.</p>
<p> IAGO. That's not amiss;</p>
<p> But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</p>
<p> Othello retires.</p>
<p> Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</p>
<p> A housewife that by selling her desires</p>
<p> Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature</p>
<p> That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague</p>
<p> To beguile many and be beguiled by one.</p>
<p> He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain</p>
<p> From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Cassio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</p>
<p> And his unbookish jealousy must construe</p>
<p> Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behavior</p>
<p> Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</p>
<p> CASSIO. The worser that you given me the addition</p>
<p> Whose want even kills me.</p>
<p> IAGO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.</p>
<p> Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,</p>
<p> How quickly should you speed!</p>
<p> CASSIO. Alas, poor caitiff!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Look, how he laughs already!</p>
<p> IAGO. I never knew a woman love man so.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.</p>
<p> IAGO. Do you hear, Cassio?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Now he importunes him</p>
<p> To tell it o'er. Go to; well said, well said.</p>
<p> IAGO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.</p>
<p> Do you intend it?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity</p>
<p> to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.</p>
<p> IAGO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Prithee, say true.</p>
<p> IAGO. I am a very villain else.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Have you scored me? Well.</p>
<p> CASSIO. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I</p>
<p> will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my</p>
<p> promise.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</p>
<p> CASSIO. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was</p>
<p> the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and</p>
<p> thither conies the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus</p>
<p> about my neck-</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Crying, &quot;O dear Cassio!&quot; as it were; his gesture imports</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p> CASSIO. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls</p>
<p> me. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see</p>
<p> that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Well, I must leave her company.</p>
<p> IAGO. Before me! look where she comes.</p>
<p> CASSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Bianca.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> What do you mean by this haunting of me?</p>
<p> BIANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by</p>
<p> that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to</p>
<p> take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work that</p>
<p> you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it</p>
<p> there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?</p>
<p> There, give it your hobbyhorse. Wheresoever you had it, I'll take</p>
<p> out no work on't.</p>
<p> CASSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!</p>
<p> BIANCA. An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an</p>
<p> you will not, come when you are next prepared for.     Exit.</p>
<p> IAGO. After her, after her.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.</p>
<p> IAGO. Will you sup there?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Faith, I intend so.</p>
<p> IAGO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak</p>
<p> with you.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Prithee, come; will you?</p>
<p> IAGO. Go to; say no more.                         Exit Cassio.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?</p>
<p> IAGO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O Iago!</p>
<p> IAGO. And did you see the handkerchief?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Was that mine?</p>
<p> IAGO. Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish</p>
<p> woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I would have him nine years skilling. A fine</p>
<p> woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!</p>
<p> IAGO. Nay, you must forget that.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for</p>
<p> she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it,</p>
<p> and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature.</p>
<p> She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.</p>
<p> IAGO. Nay, that's not your way.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her</p>
<p> needle, an admirable musician. O, she will sing the savageness</p>
<p> out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention-</p>
<p> IAGO. She's the worse for all this.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a</p>
<p> condition!</p>
<p> IAGO. Ay, too gentle.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!</p>
<p> O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!</p>
<p> IAGO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to</p>
<p> offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!</p>
<p> IAGO. O, 'tis foul in her.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. With mine officer!</p>
<p> IAGO. That's fouler.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate</p>
<p> with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This</p>
<p> night, Iago.</p>
<p> IAGO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed</p>
<p> she hath contaminated.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.</p>
<p> IAGO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more</p>
<p> by midnight.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that</p>
<p> same?</p>
<p> IAGO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico</p>
<p> Come from the Duke. And, see your wife is with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> LODOVICO. God save the worthy general!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. With all my heart, sir.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.</p>
<p> Gives him a letter.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.</p>
<p> Opens the letter, and reads.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?</p>
<p> IAGO. I am very glad to see you, signior;</p>
<p> Welcome to Cyprus.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?</p>
<p> IAGO. Lives, sir.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord</p>
<p> An unkind breech; but you shall make all well.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Are you sure of that?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. [Reads.] &quot;This fail you not to do, as you will-&quot;</p>
<p> LODOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper.</p>
<p> Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. A most unhappy one. I would do much</p>
<p> To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Fire and brimstone!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Are you wise?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. What, is he angry?</p>
<p> LODOVICO. May be the letter moved him;</p>
<p> For, as I think, they do command him home,</p>
<p> Deputing Cassio in his government.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. By my troth, I am glad on't.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Indeed!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I am glad to see you mad.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Why, sweet Othello?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Devil!                                   Strikes her.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I have not deserved this.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,</p>
<p> Though I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much.</p>
<p> Make her amends; she weeps.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O devil, devil!</p>
<p> If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,</p>
<p> Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.</p>
<p> Out of my sight!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. [Going.] I will not stay to offend you.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Truly, an obedient lady.</p>
<p> I do beseech your lordship, call her back.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Mistress!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What would you with her, sir?</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Who, I, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.</p>
<p> Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on,</p>
<p> And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;</p>
<p> And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,</p>
<p> Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.</p>
<p> Concerning this, sir- O well-painted passion!-</p>
<p> I am commanded home. Get you away;</p>
<p> I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,</p>
<p> And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!</p>
<p> Exit Desdemona.</p>
<p> Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,</p>
<p> I do entreat that we may sup together.</p>
<p> You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!</p>
<p> Exit.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate</p>
<p> Call all in all sufficient? This the nature</p>
<p> Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue</p>
<p> The shot of accident nor dart of chance</p>
<p> Could neither graze nor pierce?</p>
<p> IAGO. He is much changed.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?</p>
<p> IAGO. He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure</p>
<p> What he might be: if what he might he is not,</p>
<p> I would to heaven he were!</p>
<p> LODOVICO. What, strike his wife!</p>
<p> IAGO. Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew</p>
<p> That stroke would prove the worst!</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Is it his use?</p>
<p> Or did the letters work upon his blood,</p>
<p> And new create this fault?</p>
<p> IAGO. Alas, alas!</p>
<p> It is not honesty in me to speak</p>
<p> What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,</p>
<p> And his own courses will denote him so</p>
<p> That I may save my speech. Do but go after,</p>
<p> And mark how he continues.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. I am sorry that I am deceived in him.        Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE II.</p>
<p> A room in the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello and Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. You have seen nothing, then?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.</p>
<p> EMILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard</p>
<p> Each syllable that breath made up between them.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What, did they never whisper?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Never, my lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Never.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Never, my lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That's strange.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,</p>
<p> Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,</p>
<p> Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.</p>
<p> If any wretch have put this in your head,</p>
<p> Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!</p>
<p> For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,</p>
<p> There's no man happy; the purest of their wives</p>
<p> Is foul as slander.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Bid her come hither; go.                 Exit Emilia.</p>
<p> She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd</p>
<p> That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,</p>
<p> A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.</p>
<p> And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Desdemona with Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Pray, chuck, come hither.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. What is your pleasure?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Let me see your eyes;</p>
<p> Look in my face.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. What horrible fancy's this?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. [To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,</p>
<p> Leave procreants alone and shut the door;</p>
<p> Cough, or cry &quot;hem,&quot; if anybody come.</p>
<p> Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch.      Exit Emilia.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?</p>
<p> I understand a fury in your words,</p>
<p> But not the words.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why, what art thou?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself;</p>
<p> Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves</p>
<p> Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn'd;</p>
<p> Swear thou art honest.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Heaven doth truly know it.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O Desdemona! Away! away! away!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?</p>
<p> Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?</p>
<p> If haply you my father do suspect</p>
<p> An instrument of this your calling back,</p>
<p> Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,</p>
<p> Why, I have lost him too.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Had it pleased heaven</p>
<p> To try me with affliction, had they rain'd</p>
<p> All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,</p>
<p> Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,</p>
<p> Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,</p>
<p> I should have found in some place of my soul</p>
<p> A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me</p>
<p> A fixed figure for the time of scorn</p>
<p> To point his slow unmoving finger at!</p>
<p> Yet could I bear that too, well, very well;</p>
<p> But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,</p>
<p> Where either I must live or bear no life;</p>
<p> The fountain from the which my current runs,</p>
<p> Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!</p>
<p> Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads</p>
<p> To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,</p>
<p> Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,</p>
<p> Ay, there, look grim as hell!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,</p>
<p> That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,</p>
<p> Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet</p>
<p> That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,</p>
<p> Made to write &quot;whore&quot; upon? What committed?</p>
<p> Committed? O thou public commoner!</p>
<p> I should make very forges of my cheeks,</p>
<p> That would to cinders burn up modesty,</p>
<p> Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!</p>
<p> Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;</p>
<p> The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,</p>
<p> Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,</p>
<p> And will not hear it. What committed?</p>
<p> Impudent strumpet!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. By heaven, you do me wrong.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Are not you a strumpet?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. No, as I am a Christian.</p>
<p> If to preserve this vessel for my lord</p>
<p> From any other foul unlawful touch</p>
<p> Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What, not a whore?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. No, as I shall be saved.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Is't possible?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I cry you mercy then;</p>
<p> I took you for that cunning whore of Venice</p>
<p> That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,</p>
<p> That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,</p>
<p> And keep the gate of hell!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> You, you, ay, you!</p>
<p> We have done our course; there's money for your pains.</p>
<p> I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.        Exit.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?</p>
<p> How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. With who?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Who is thy lord?</p>
<p> EMILIA. He that is yours, sweet lady.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;</p>
<p> I cannot weep, nor answer have I none</p>
<p> But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight</p>
<p> Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember,</p>
<p> And call thy husband hither.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Here's a change indeed!</p>
<p> Exit.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.</p>
<p> How have I been behaved, that he might stick</p>
<p> The small'st opinion on my least misuse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Emilia with Iago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes</p>
<p> Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.</p>
<p> He might have chid me so, for in good faith,</p>
<p> I am a child to chiding.</p>
<p> IAGO. What's the matter, lady?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so be whored her,</p>
<p> Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,</p>
<p> As true hearts cannot bear.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?</p>
<p> IAGO. What name, fair lady?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.</p>
<p> EMILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink</p>
<p> Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.</p>
<p> IAGO. Why did he so?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.</p>
<p> IAGO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!</p>
<p> EMILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,</p>
<p> Her father and her country and her friends,</p>
<p> To be call'd whore? Would it not make one weep?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.</p>
<p> IAGO. Beshrew him for't!</p>
<p> How comes this trick upon him?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Nay, heaven doth know.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,</p>
<p> Some busy and insinuating rogue,</p>
<p> Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,</p>
<p> Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.</p>
<p> IAGO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!</p>
<p> EMILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!</p>
<p> Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company?</p>
<p> What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?</p>
<p> The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave,</p>
<p> Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.</p>
<p> O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,</p>
<p> And put in every honest hand a whip</p>
<p> To lash the rascals naked through the world</p>
<p> Even from the east to the west!</p>
<p> IAGO. Speak within door.</p>
<p> EMILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was</p>
<p> That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,</p>
<p> And made you to suspect me with the Moor.</p>
<p> IAGO. You are a fool; go to.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O good Iago,</p>
<p> What shall I do to win my lord again?</p>
<p> Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,</p>
<p> I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:</p>
<p> If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love</p>
<p> Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,</p>
<p> Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,</p>
<p> Delighted them in any other form,</p>
<p> Or that I do not yet, and ever did,</p>
<p> And ever will, though he do shake me off</p>
<p> To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,</p>
<p> Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,</p>
<p> And his unkindness may defeat my life,</p>
<p> But never taint my love. I cannot say &quot;whore.&quot;</p>
<p> It doth abhor me now I speak the word;</p>
<p> To do the act that might the addition earn</p>
<p> Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.</p>
<p> IAGO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:</p>
<p> The business of the state does him offense,</p>
<p> And he does chide with you.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. If 'twere no other-</p>
<p> IAGO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                 Trumpets within.</p>
<p> Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!</p>
<p> The messengers of Venice stay the meat.</p>
<p> Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.</p>
<p> Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Roderigo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> How now, Roderigo!</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.</p>
<p> IAGO. What in the contrary?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Every day thou doffest me with some device, Iago; and</p>
<p> rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency</p>
<p> than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed</p>
<p> no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace</p>
<p> what already I have foolishly  suffered.</p>
<p> IAGO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and</p>
<p> performances are no kin together.</p>
<p> IAGO. You charge me most unjustly.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my</p>
<p> means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona</p>
<p> would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath</p>
<p> received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden</p>
<p> respect and acquaintance; but I find none.</p>
<p> IAGO. Well, go to, very well.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very</p>
<p> well. By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find</p>
<p> myself fopped in it.</p>
<p> IAGO. Very well.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known</p>
<p> to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over</p>
<p> my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure</p>
<p> yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.</p>
<p> IAGO. You have said now.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of</p>
<p> doing.</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this</p>
<p> instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give</p>
<p> me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just</p>
<p> exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy</p>
<p> affair.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I that hath not appeared.</p>
<p> IAGO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is</p>
<p> not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that</p>
<p> in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than</p>
<p> ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it; if</p>
<p> thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from</p>
<p> this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?</p>
<p> IAGO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute</p>
<p> Cassio in Othello's place.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again</p>
<p> to Venice.</p>
<p> IAGO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the</p>
<p> fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some</p>
<p> accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of</p>
<p> Cassio.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?</p>
<p> IAGO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out</p>
<p> his brains.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. And that you would have me to do?</p>
<p> IAGO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups</p>
<p> tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows</p>
<p> not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going</p>
<p> thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and</p>
<p> one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second</p>
<p> your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not</p>
<p> amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a</p>
<p> necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put</p>
<p> it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to</p>
<p> waste. About it.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.</p>
<p> IAGO. And you shall be satisfied.                      Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE III.</p>
<p> Another room in the castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> LODOVICO. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Your honor is most welcome.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Will you walk, sir? O- Desdemona-</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned</p>
<p> forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there; look it be done.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I will, my lord.</p>
<p> Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants.</p>
<p> EMILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.</p>
<p> He hath commanded me to go to bed,</p>
<p> And bade me to dismiss you.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Dismiss me?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,</p>
<p> Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.</p>
<p> We must not now displease him.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I would you had never seen him!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,</p>
<p> That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns-</p>
<p> Prithee, unpin me- have grace and favor in them.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!</p>
<p> If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me</p>
<p> In one of those same sheets.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Come, come, you talk.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;</p>
<p> She was in love, and he she loved proved mad</p>
<p> And did forsake her. She had a song of &quot;willow&quot;;</p>
<p> An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,</p>
<p> And she died singing it. That song tonight</p>
<p> Will not go from my mind; I have much to do</p>
<p> But to go hang my head all at one side</p>
<p> And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. No, unpin me here.</p>
<p> This Lodovico is a proper man.</p>
<p> EMILIA. A very handsome man.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. He speaks well.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to</p>
<p> Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. [Sings.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,</p>
<p> Sing all a green willow;</p>
<p> Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,</p>
<p> Sing willow, willow, willow.</p>
<p> The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans,</p>
<p> Sing willow, willow, willow;</p>
<p> Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones-&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Lay be these-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [Sings.]   &quot;Sing willow, willow, willow-&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon-</p>
<p> [Sings.]   &quot;Sing all a green willow must be my garland.</p>
<p> Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve-&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Nay, that's not next. Hark, who is't that knocks?</p>
<p> EMILIA. It's the wind.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. [Sings.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?</p>
<p> Sing willow, willow, willow.</p>
<p> If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men-&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> So get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;</p>
<p> Doth that bode weeping?</p>
<p> EMILIA. 'Tis neither here nor there.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!</p>
<p> Dost thou in conscience think- tell me, Emilia-</p>
<p> That there be women do abuse their husbands</p>
<p> In such gross kind?</p>
<p> EMILIA. There be some such, no question.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Why, would not you?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. No, by this heavenly light!</p>
<p> EMILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well</p>
<p> i' the dark.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p>
<p> EMILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price</p>
<p> For a small vice.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</p>
<p> EMILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.</p>
<p> Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for</p>
<p> measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any</p>
<p> petty exhibition; but, for the whole world- why, who would not</p>
<p> make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should</p>
<p> venture purgatory for't.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Be shrew me, if I would do such a wrong</p>
<p> For the whole world.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the</p>
<p> world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you</p>
<p> might quickly make it right.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the</p>
<p> world they played for.</p>
<p> But I do think it is their husbands' faults</p>
<p> If wives do fall; say that they slack their duties</p>
<p> And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</p>
<p> Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</p>
<p> Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us,</p>
<p> Or scant our former having in despite,</p>
<p> Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</p>
<p> Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</p>
<p> Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell</p>
<p> And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</p>
<p> As husbands have. What is it that they do</p>
<p> When they change us for others? Is it sport?</p>
<p> I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</p>
<p> I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus errs?</p>
<p> It is so too. And have not we affections,</p>
<p> Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</p>
<p> Then let them use us well; else let them know,</p>
<p> The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,</p>
<p> Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!           Exeunt.</p>
<p> ACT V. SCENE I.</p>
<p> Cyprus. A street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Iago and Roderigo:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> IAGO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.</p>
<p> Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.</p>
<p> Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.</p>
<p> It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,</p>
<p> And fix most firm thy resolution.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.</p>
<p> IAGO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.</p>
<p> Retires.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;</p>
<p> And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.</p>
<p> 'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.</p>
<p> IAGO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,</p>
<p> And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,</p>
<p> Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,</p>
<p> Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,</p>
<p> He calls me to a restitution large</p>
<p> Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,</p>
<p> As gifts to Desdemona;</p>
<p> It must not be. If Cassio do remain,</p>
<p> He hath a daily beauty in his life</p>
<p> That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor</p>
<p> May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.</p>
<p> No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Cassio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> RODERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!</p>
<p> Makes a pass at Cassio.</p>
<p> CASSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,</p>
<p> But that my coat is better than thou know'st;</p>
<p> I will make proof of thine.      Draws, and wounds Roderigo.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. O, I am slain!</p>
<p> Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit.</p>
<p> CASSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!</p>
<p> Falls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. O, villain that I am!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. It is even so.</p>
<p> CASSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,</p>
<p> That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!</p>
<p> Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,</p>
<p> And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!</p>
<p> Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;</p>
<p> Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.</p>
<p> Exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CASSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!</p>
<p> GRATIANO. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.</p>
<p> CASSIO. O, help!</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Hark!</p>
<p> RODERIGO. O wretched villain!</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.</p>
<p> These may be counterfeits; let's think't unsafe</p>
<p> To come in to the cry without more help.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Hark!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Iago, with a light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> GRATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.</p>
<p> IAGO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?</p>
<p> LODOVICO. We do not know.</p>
<p> IAGO. Did not you hear a cry?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!</p>
<p> IAGO. What's the matter?</p>
<p> GRATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.</p>
<p> IAGO. What are you here that cry so grievously?</p>
<p> CASSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!</p>
<p> Give me some help.</p>
<p> IAGO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I think that one of them is here about,</p>
<p> And cannot make away.</p>
<p> IAGO. O treacherous villains!</p>
<p> [To Lodovico and Gratiano.] What are you there?</p>
<p> Come in and give some help.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. O, help me here!</p>
<p> CASSIO. That's one of them.</p>
<p> IAGO. O murtherous slave! O villain!</p>
<p> Stabs Roderigo.</p>
<p> RODERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!</p>
<p> IAGO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?</p>
<p> How silent is this town! Ho! Murther! Murther!</p>
<p> What may you be? Are you of good or evil?</p>
<p> LODOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.</p>
<p> IAGO. Signior Lodovico?</p>
<p> LODOVICO. He, sir.</p>
<p> IAGO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. Cassio?</p>
<p> IAGO. How is't, brother?</p>
<p> CASSIO. My leg is cut in two.</p>
<p> IAGO. Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p> Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Bianca.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> BIANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?</p>
<p> IAGO. Who is't that cried?</p>
<p> BIANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,</p>
<p> Cassio!</p>
<p> IAGO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect</p>
<p> Who they should be that have thus mangled you?</p>
<p> CASSIO. No.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.</p>
<p> IAGO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,</p>
<p> To bear him easily hence!</p>
<p> BIANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!</p>
<p> IAGO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash</p>
<p> To be a party in this injury.</p>
<p> Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;</p>
<p> Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?</p>
<p> Alas, my friend and my dear countryman</p>
<p> Roderigo? No- yes, sure. O heaven! Roderigo.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. What, of Venice?</p>
<p> IAGO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?</p>
<p> GRATIANO. Know him! ay.</p>
<p> IAGO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;</p>
<p> These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,</p>
<p> That so neglected you.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. I am glad to see you.</p>
<p> IAGO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!</p>
<p> GRATIANO. Roderigo!</p>
<p> IAGO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:</p>
<p> the chair.</p>
<p> Some good man bear him carefully from hence;</p>
<p> I'll fetch the general's surgeon. [To Bianca.] For you, mistress,</p>
<p> Save you your labor. He that lies slain here, Cassio,</p>
<p> Was my dear friend; what malice was between you?</p>
<p> CASSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.</p>
<p> IAGO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.</p>
<p> Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.</p>
<p> Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?</p>
<p> Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?</p>
<p> Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.</p>
<p> Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.</p>
<p> Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,</p>
<p> Though tongues were out of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> EMILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?</p>
<p> IAGO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark</p>
<p> By Roderigo, and fellows that are 'scaped;</p>
<p> He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!</p>
<p> IAGO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,</p>
<p> Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight.</p>
<p> What, do you shake at that?</p>
<p> BIANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.</p>
<p> IAGO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!</p>
<p> BIANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest</p>
<p> As you that thus abuse me.</p>
<p> EMILIA. As I! foh! fie upon thee!</p>
<p> IAGO. Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.</p>
<p> Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.</p>
<p> Emilia, run you to the citadel,</p>
<p> And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!</p>
<p> Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night</p>
<p> That either makes me or fordoes me quite.            Exeunt.</p>
<p> SCENE II.</p>
<p> A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep;</p>
<p> a light burning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Othello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> OTHELLO. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.</p>
<p> Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!</p>
<p> It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,</p>
<p> Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow</p>
<p> And smooth as monumental alabaster.</p>
<p> Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.</p>
<p> Put out the light, and then put out the light.</p>
<p> If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</p>
<p> I can again thy former light restore,</p>
<p> Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,</p>
<p> Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,</p>
<p> I know not where is that Promethean heat</p>
<p> That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Well, do it, and be brief- I will walk by.</p>
<p> I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.</p>
<p> No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Talk you of killing?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, I do.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Then heaven have mercy on me!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Amen, with all my heart!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Hum!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then</p>
<p> When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,</p>
<p> Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Think on thy sins.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. They are loves I bear to you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. That death's unnatural that kills for loving.</p>
<p> Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?</p>
<p> Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.</p>
<p> These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Well, do it, and be brief-I will walk by.</p>
<p> I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.</p>
<p> No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Talk you of killing?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, I do.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Then heaven have mercy on me!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Amen, with all my heart!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Hum!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then</p>
<p> When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,</p>
<p> Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Think on thy sins.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. They are loves I bear to you.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. That death's unnatural that kills for loving.</p>
<p> Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?</p>
<p> Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.</p>
<p> These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,</p>
<p> They do not point on me.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Peace, and be still!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. I will so. What's the matter?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee</p>
<p> Thou gavest to Cassio.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. No, by my life and soul!</p>
<p> Send for the man, and ask him.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Sweet soul, take heed,</p>
<p> Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Ay, but not yet to die.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Yes, presently:</p>
<p> Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,</p>
<p> For to deny each article with oath</p>
<p> Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception</p>
<p> That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA Then Lord have mercy on me!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I say, amen.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. And have you mercy too! I never did</p>
<p> Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio</p>
<p> But with such general warranty of heaven</p>
<p> As I might love. I never gave him token.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.</p>
<p> O perjured woman! Thou dost stone my heart,</p>
<p> And makest me call what I intend to do</p>
<p> A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.</p>
<p> I saw the handkerchief.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. He found it then;</p>
<p> I never gave it him. Send for him hither;</p>
<p> Let him confess a truth.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. He hath confess'd.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. What, my lord?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That he hath used thee.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. How? unlawfully?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. He will not say so.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. No, his mouth is stopp'd;</p>
<p> Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, my fear interprets! What, is he dead?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Had all his hair been lives, my great revenge</p>
<p> Had stomach for them all.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Down, strumpet!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nay, if you strive-</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. But half an hour!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Being done, there is no pause.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. But while I say one prayer!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. It is too late.                       He stifles her.</p>
<p> EMILIA. [Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?</p>
<p> I that am cruel am yet merciful;</p>
<p> I would not have thee linger in thy pain.</p>
<p> So, so.</p>
<p> EMILIA. [Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Who's there?</p>
<p> EMILIA. [Within.] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.</p>
<p> 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.</p>
<p> The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?</p>
<p> Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?</p>
<p> I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?</p>
<p> If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife.</p>
<p> My wife! My wife! What wife? I have no wife.</p>
<p> O, insupportable! O heavy hour!</p>
<p> Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</p>
<p> Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe</p>
<p> Should yawn at alteration.</p>
<p> EMILIA. [Within.] I do beseech you</p>
<p> That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.</p>
<p> Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw.</p>
<p> Where art thou?                            Unlocks the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Emilia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> What's the matter with thee now?</p>
<p> EMILIA. O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What, now?</p>
<p> EMILIA. But now, my lord.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon;</p>
<p> She comes more nearer earth than she was wont</p>
<p> And makes men mad.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian</p>
<p> Call'd Roderigo.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Roderigo kill'd?</p>
<p> And Cassio kill'd?</p>
<p> EMILIA. No, Cassio is not kill'd.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,</p>
<p> And sweet revenge grows harsh.</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd!</p>
<p> EMILIA. Alas, what cry is that?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That? what?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice.</p>
<p> Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!</p>
<p> Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. A guiltless death I die.</p>
<p> EMILIA. O, who hath done this deed?</p>
<p> DESDEMONA. Nobody; I myself. Farewell;</p>
<p> Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell!               Dies.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why, how should she be murther'd?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Alas, who knows?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.</p>
<p> EMILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;</p>
<p> 'Twas I that kill'd her.</p>
<p> EMILIA. O, the more angel she,</p>
<p> And you the blacker devil!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. She was false as water.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Thou art rash as fire, to say</p>
<p> That she was false. O, she was heavenly true!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.</p>
<p> O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,</p>
<p> But that I did proceed upon just grounds</p>
<p> To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.</p>
<p> EMILIA. My husband?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Thy husband.</p>
<p> EMILIA. That she was false to wedlock?</p>
<p> O Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,</p>
<p> If heaven would make me such another world</p>
<p> Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,</p>
<p> lid not have sold her for it.</p>
<p> EMILIA. My husband?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay, 'twas he that told me first.</p>
<p> An honest man he is, and hates the slime</p>
<p> That sticks on filthy deeds.</p>
<p> EMILIA. My husband?<br />
</p>
<p> OTHELLO. What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.</p>
<p> EMILIA. O Mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!</p>
<p> My husband say that she was false!</p>
<p> OTHELLO. He, woman;</p>
<p> I say thy husband. Dost understand the word?</p>
<p> My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.</p>
<p> EMILIA. If he say so, may his pernicious soul</p>
<p> Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart.</p>
<p> She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ha!</p>
<p> EMILIA. Do thy worst;</p>
<p> This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven</p>
<p> Than thou wast worthy her.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Peace, you were best.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm</p>
<p> As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!</p>
<p> As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-</p>
<p> I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,</p>
<p> Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!</p>
<p> The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> MONTANO. What is the matter? How now, general?</p>
<p> EMILIA. O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,</p>
<p> That men must lay their murthers on your neck.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. What is the matter?</p>
<p> EMILIA. Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.</p>
<p> He says thou told'st him that his wife was false;</p>
<p> I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain.</p>
<p> Speak, for my heart is full.</p>
<p> IAGO. I told him what I thought, and told no more</p>
<p> Than what he found himself was apt and true.</p>
<p> EMILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?</p>
<p> IAGO. I did.</p>
<p> EMILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;</p>
<p> Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!</p>
<p> She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?</p>
<p> IAGO. With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.</p>
<p> My mistress here lies murther'd in her bed-</p>
<p> ALL. O heavens forfend!</p>
<p> EMILIA. And your reports have set the murther on.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. 'Tis a strange truth.</p>
<p> MONTANO. O monstrous act!</p>
<p> EMILIA. Villainy, villainy, villainy!</p>
<p> I think upon't, I think, I smell't, O villainy!</p>
<p> I thought so then. I'll kill myself for grief.</p>
<p> O villainy, villainy!</p>
<p> IAGO. What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;</p>
<p> 'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.</p>
<p> Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O! O! O!                            Falls on the bed.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Nay, lay thee down and roar;</p>
<p> For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent</p>
<p> That e'er did lift up eye.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. [Rises.] O, she was foul!</p>
<p> I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece,</p>
<p> Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd.</p>
<p> I know this act shows horrible and grim.</p>
<p> GRATIANO Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead.</p>
<p> Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief</p>
<p> Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,</p>
<p> This sight would make him do a desperate turn,</p>
<p> Yea, curse his better angel from his side,</p>
<p> And fall to reprobation.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. 'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows</p>
<p> That she with Cassio hath the act of shame</p>
<p> A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,</p>
<p> And she did gratify his amorous works</p>
<p> With that recognizance and pledge of love</p>
<p> Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand,</p>
<p> It was a handkerchief, an antique token</p>
<p> My father gave my mother.</p>
<p> EMILIA. O heaven! O heavenly powers!</p>
<p> IAGO. 'Zounds! Hold your peace.</p>
<p> EMILIA. 'Twill out, 'twill. I peace?</p>
<p> No, I will speak as liberal as the north;</p>
<p> Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,</p>
<p> All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.</p>
<p> IAGO. Be wise, and get you home.</p>
<p> EMILIA. I will not.</p>
<p> Iago offers to stab Emilia.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. Fie!</p>
<p> Your sword upon a woman?</p>
<p> EMILIA. O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak'st of</p>
<p> I found by fortune and did give my husband,</p>
<p> For often with a solemn earnestness,</p>
<p> More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,</p>
<p> He begg'd of me to steal it.</p>
<p> IAGO. Villainous whore!</p>
<p> EMILIA. She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,</p>
<p> And I did give't my husband.</p>
<p> IAGO. Filth, thou liest!</p>
<p> EMILIA. By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.</p>
<p> O murtherous coxcomb! What should such a fool</p>
<p> Do with so good a wife?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Are there not stones in heaven</p>
<p> But what serve for thunder? Precious villain!</p>
<p> He runs at Iago, but Montano</p>
<p> disarms him. Iago stabs Emilia.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.</p>
<p> EMILIA. Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.     Exit Iago.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.</p>
<p> MONTANO. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,</p>
<p> Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.</p>
<p> Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,</p>
<p> But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,</p>
<p> For 'tis a damned slave.</p>
<p> Exeunt all but Othello and Emilia.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I am not valiant neither,</p>
<p> But every puny whipster gets my sword.</p>
<p> But why should honor outlive honesty?</p>
<p> But why should honor outlive honesty?</p>
<p> Let it go all.</p>
<p> EMILIA. What did thy song bode, lady?</p>
<p> Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,</p>
<p> And die in music. [Sings.] &quot;Willow, willow, willow.&quot;</p>
<p> Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;</p>
<p> So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;</p>
<p> So speaking as I think, I die, I die.                  Dies.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber;</p>
<p> It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper-</p>
<p> O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.</p>
<p> GRATIANO. [Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.</p>
<p> Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,</p>
<p> Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Re-enter Gratiano.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> GRATIANO. What is the matter?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Behold, I have a weapon;</p>
<p> A better never did itself sustain</p>
<p> Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day</p>
<p> That with this little arm and this good sword</p>
<p> I have made my way through more impediments</p>
<p> Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!</p>
<p> Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.</p>
<p> Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;</p>
<p> Here is my journey's end, here is my butt</p>
<p> And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.</p>
<p> Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.</p>
<p> Man but a rush against Othello's breast,</p>
<p> And he retires. Where should Othello go?</p>
<p> Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!</p>
<p> Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,</p>
<p> This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</p>
<p> And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?</p>
<p> Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!</p>
<p> Whip me, ye devils,</p>
<p> From the possession of this heavenly sight!</p>
<p> Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!</p>
<p> Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!</p>
<p> O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!</p>
<p> O! O! O!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair,</p>
<p> and Officers with Iago, prisoner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. That's he that was Othello. Here I am.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.</p>
<p> If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.</p>
<p> Wounds Iago.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Wrench his sword from him.</p>
<p> IAGO. I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I am not sorry neither. I'd have thee live,</p>
<p> For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. O thou Othello, that wert once so good,</p>
<p> Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave,</p>
<p> What shall be said to thee?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Why, anything;</p>
<p> An honorable murtherer, if you will,</p>
<p> For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.</p>
<p> Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Ay.</p>
<p> CASSIO. Dear general, I never gave you cause.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</p>
<p> Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</p>
<p> Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</p>
<p> IAGO. Demand me nothing; what you know, you know.</p>
<p> From this time forth I never will speak word.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. What, not to pray?</p>
<p> GRATIANO. Torments will ope your lips.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Well, thou dost best.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,</p>
<p> Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</p>
<p> Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,</p>
<p> And here another. The one of them imports</p>
<p> The death of Cassio to be undertook</p>
<p> By Roderigo.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O villain!</p>
<p> CASSIO. Most heathenish and most gross!</p>
<p> LODOVICO. Now here's another discontented paper,</p>
<p> Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,</p>
<p> Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;</p>
<p> But that, belike, Iago in the interim</p>
<p> Came in and satisfied him.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O the pernicious caitiff!</p>
<p> How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</p>
<p> That was my wife's?</p>
<p> CASSIO. I found it in my chamber;</p>
<p> And he himself confess'd but even now</p>
<p> That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose</p>
<p> Which wrought to his desire.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. O fool! fool! fool!</p>
<p> CASSIO. There is besides in Roderigo's letter,</p>
<p> How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</p>
<p> Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came</p>
<p> That I was cast. And even but now he spake</p>
<p> After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,</p>
<p> Iago set him on.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. You must forsake this room, and go with us.</p>
<p> Your power and your command is taken off,</p>
<p> And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</p>
<p> If there be any cunning cruelty</p>
<p> That can torment him much and hold him long,</p>
<p> It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</p>
<p> Till that the nature of your fault be known</p>
<p> To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. Soft you. a word or two before you go.</p>
<p> I have done the state some service, and they know't.</p>
<p> No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</p>
<p> When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</p>
<p> Speak of me as I am. nothing extenuate,</p>
<p> Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</p>
<p> Of one that loved not wisely but too well;</p>
<p> Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,</p>
<p> Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,</p>
<p> Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away</p>
<p> Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,</p>
<p> Albeit unused to the melting mood,</p>
<p> Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees</p>
<p> Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;</p>
<p> And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</p>
<p> Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk</p>
<p> Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,</p>
<p> I took by the throat the circumcised dog</p>
<p> And smote him, thus.                          Stabs himself.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. O bloody period!</p>
<p> GRATIANO. All that's spoke is marr'd.</p>
<p> OTHELLO. I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee. No way but this,</p>
<p> Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</p>
<p> Falls on the bed, and dies.</p>
<p> CASSIO. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;</p>
<p> For he was great of heart.</p>
<p> LODOVICO. [To Iago.] O Spartan dog,</p>
<p> More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!</p>
<p> Look on the tragic loading of this bed;</p>
<p> This is thy work. The object poisons sight;</p>
<p> Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,</p>
<p> And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,</p>
<p> For they succeed on you. To you, Lord Governor,</p>
<p> Remains the censure of this hellish villain,</p>
<p> The time, the place, the torture. O, enforce it!</p>
<p> Myself will straight aboard, and to the state</p>
<p> This heavy act with heavy heart relate.              Exeunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> -THE END-</p>
