INTRODUCTION<br>
You are about to read the most amazing story of your life. So, sit back and<br>
enjoy because, if you let it, it will take you on a fascinating journey -- a journey<br>
that will show you how to master your own life and the conditions around you.<br>
Look forward to a significantly more successful life. To make it happen you<br>
must pay close attention to the techniques described in Part II and faithfully follow<br>
these instructions as if they are meant just for you. The truth of it is: they are.<br>
Let me stress the importance of reading Part II more than once. In fact, if<br>
you truly want great things to happen, read it at least once a week for the first two<br>
months, then once a month thereafter.<br>
Why should you do this? There are several good reasons, actually. And<br>
since you will discover them on your own, there is no need to mention them here.<br>
I very much look forward to meeting you someday. For now -- read, enjoy,<br>
and prosper.<br>
I'll see you on the other side. <br>

The Magic Story<br>
(PART I)<br>
Presuming that there are many who are just as skeptical concerning things<br>
bordering on the extraordinary as I have been practically all of my life, I offer the<br>
following story and system of practice to each reader for what it is worth, with the<br>
suggestion that he take it or leave it, just as he sees fit.<br>
It was Saturday afternoon and I had returned from a late lunch. The help had<br>
left for the day and I was alone. My business had dropped off considerably of late<br>
and while conditions were not alarming, yet they were sufficient to cause me some<br>
concern. Then again, I had recently indulged in some real estate speculation which<br>
had not proved successful. Taking it all in all, it was not a very cheerful outlook.<br>
In fact the most serious problem of my business career was up for solution.<br>
Sitting there in deep thought in an effort to discover a way out, I was<br>
aroused by the telephone. I was startled at hearing the familiar voice of my old<br>
friend, David Bentley. It required no great stretch of the imagination to believe it a<br>
voice from the dead, for less than a month before he had left for Europe on the <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>

urgent advice of his physician to take an ocean voyage, preferably, but get away<br>
somewhere, in the hope that a change would effect an improvement in his<br>
condition, which was a serious breakdown due to worry over conditions, which,<br>
strangely, were similar to what I was now experiencing.<br>
As he spoke, his voice carried such striking power and feeling that I was<br>
reminded of my last impression of Dave as we sorrowfully parted with him, a<br>
miserable shadow of his former self, and we questioned as to whether we would<br>
ever see him again.<br>
But here he was back again, and surely some great change had taken place in<br>
him. Remarking that a miracle must have happened, he assured me that I had<br>
guessed about right, adding, &quot;Tom, I know that you are puzzled over my early<br>
return and I also know that you never expected to see me again. But I'm back and<br>
I'm the luckiest man in the world, for I learned something that I never knew<br>
existed. Tom, nothing is impossible with me any more, for I can do anything. I am<br>
master of my own destiny and I can make my life anything that I wish it to be.<br>
&quot;Oh, don't think I'm crazy. Wait until you hear my story.&quot; Feigning a laugh<br>
to cover my serious curiosity, I remarked that he must have stumbled over some<br>
new-fangled religion. To which he replied, &quot;On the contrary, it concerns no<br>
religion of any kind or of anybody. You see, I met a Master. A wonderful man<br>
who has so developed his powers that he can do anything, and he taught me a<br>
secret that no price could ever buy. You know that I lost my health and I lost my <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 6 -<br>
wealth. Well, I have regained my health and I will have the wealth in no time. Oh,<br>
it's a strange story.&quot; Of course I became excited to see him at once and when to his<br>
inquiry about the club I replied that there were no changes, he hung up after<br>
saying, &quot;Meet me there at 9:00 tonight and I will unfold a series of the most<br>
remarkable and fortunate happenings that could fall to the lot of any man.&quot;<br>
I sat there unmoved for some minutes like a man in a dream, so completely<br>
absorbed had I become in the remarkable recital. Upon recovering myself I<br>
became possessed of the feeling that I had suddenly grown too big for the office.<br>
That I had outgrown that little place. I must get outside and expand in the fresh air.<br>
Feverish with excitement, I put on my hat and stepped out. Feeling that there was<br>
something wonderful for me in his story, I was seized with an uncontrollable desire<br>
to hear it at once. I turned in the direction of his office but recalling that he was no<br>
longer there, was forced to wait until evening. The remainder of that day was<br>
spent in restlessly pacing the streets and I was greatly relieved when the hour to go<br>
to the club arrived.<br>
Having resolved to get Dave away where we would not be disturbed, I<br>
entered and stepped quickly to the desk, only to be informed that he had<br>
telephoned some time before to tell me that he had been called away and would be<br>
back the following evening. Trying to conceal my disappointment and feelings, I<br>
turned quickly and was greeted by three friends who had seen him, and each was<br>
excitedly trying to tell me of the wonders that had taken place. Miserable and <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 7 -<br>
disconsolate, I broke away from them without uttering a word, walked out into the<br>
night and home.<br>
Too agitated for sleep, the greater part of the night was passed in restless<br>
confusion. Assailed by the most illogical thoughts, I decided that the whole thing<br>
was a myth, conjured up in a mind weakened as the result of affliction. How<br>
utterly ridiculous to allow myself to become upset by such a fairy tale. But no,<br>
somehow the thing would not down, but kept forcing itself upon me, until in<br>
desperation I tried to console myself with the assurance that I would at any cost<br>
learn the truth or falsity of the whole matter the next day.<br>
Following instructions which I had left at the club to be delivered to him<br>
immediately upon his return, Dave picked me up at my home in a new, high-priced<br>
car, and we drove out to a highway cafe. There, in a private dining-room,<br>
undisturbed by the presence of others, I had opportunity to study my old friend.<br>
Surely some miraculous change had taken place in him. His countenance<br>
glowed with health and vitality and his calm, poised bearing inspired wonderful<br>
admiration and confidence. But while I felt perfectly at ease in his company, I also<br>
felt the force of some presence in him that I could neither understand nor describe.<br>
Whatever it was, it had the effect of putting one at ease and yet had the tendency to<br>
command respect for something one did not understand. While I felt greatly<br>
relieved after the excitement of the previous day, yet I found difficulty in<br>
concealing the emotions that surged up within me, for I felt satisfied and convinced <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 8 -<br>
that he had something that I sorely needed and I had the strangest fear lest<br>
something might occur even then to prevent my getting it.<br>
He broke a momentary silence that seemed hours to me by asking, &quot;Tom, do<br>
I look any different than the day I left?&quot; I had to admit that he was both a<br>
revelation and a mystery to me. He continued, &quot;It was in a theatre in London that I<br>
met the man, or the Master, as he is called, that I am deeply grateful for the<br>
privilege of calling my friend. Tom, you didn't know that I left here determined to<br>
end it all. I had made such a mess of my affairs. But I feared to live and I feared<br>
to die. I couldn't rest. To keep moving was my only relief. I guess I was what the<br>
world would call a hopeless case.<br>
&quot;As I look back upon that evening in London, how well I now realize that<br>
my utter despondency and the intense longing to find something to relieve me drew<br>
me and my dear friend together. I had decided upon a regular orchestra seat, but<br>
discovered that for some unexplainable reason I had ordered a box and found<br>
myself seated beside my friend. Extraordinary happenings, such as this, occur<br>
frequently to many of us and are explained away, because of our ignorance, as<br>
merely coincidences. But I know differently now.<br>
&quot;I could feel that my uneasiness attracted his attention. The wonderful<br>
radiance of his countenance assured me that he was an unusual personage and I felt<br>
an instinctive urge to open my heart to him. The remark, 'I am sorely troubled,'<br>
uttered by a character upon the stage started our acquaintance. I replied 'So am I,' <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 9 -<br>
in just a whisper, but my friend heard it and turning to me he asked, 'Are you<br>
troubled?' I nodded my head in response and you may believe me or not, but<br>
almost immediately I was at ease. Something seemed to tell me that I had the good<br>
fortune of being in the presence of one of those great spiritual people of whom I<br>
had read quite a bit in earlier years.<br>
&quot;I felt convinced that I had met my deliverer, and at the close of the<br>
performance was overjoyed at his invitation to accompany him to a nearby cafe. I<br>
noticed that the attention of those in the cafe was drawn toward him as we entered<br>
and that the management was noticeably respectful and courteous toward him.<br>
Having convinced myself that this man possessed some sort of magical power, I<br>
determined to ask him all the questions that I could think of and with his<br>
permission make notes of his answers.<br>
&quot;Learning that he was taking a steamer for New York the next day, I asked if<br>
I might accompany him, to which he assented. At the conclusion of our talk I<br>
observed that he merely wrote his initials on the bill and as we stepped outside to<br>
call a cab I questioned him regarding this and he admitted that he was not known<br>
there, as this was his first visit to the place, but he assured me that they would be<br>
paid, adding, 'I did this to show you that man in his right domain controls every<br>
situation.' I was still puzzled, but carried the subject no further, hoping that it<br>
would all be made plain to me later. <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 10 -<br>
&quot;That night, as I lay in a doze, the events of the evening kept passing<br>
through my mind and at times I found difficulty in realizing that my good fortune<br>
was real, rather than the illusion of a dream. That night I had the first peaceful<br>
sleep in months.&quot;<br>
&quot;The following morning, up early and supremely happy and eager for what<br>
the day would unfold, I immediately applied for a reservation on the steamer, only<br>
to be informed that they had a full passenger list, but as I turned away, almost<br>
heartbroken at such an unfortunate turn of events, I was recalled by the clerk with<br>
the information that a reservation had just been cancelled and that I might have it.<br>
Instantly I felt forcibly struck with the thought that here was more of my friend's<br>
'magic,' as I then called it, and I was not mistaken, for he later admitted that he had<br>
made a place for me. Of course, you do not understand how the thing works, Tom.<br>
Neither did I, at the time, but I do now, and it is oh, so simple. I believe its<br>
simplicity causes it to be overlooked.<br>
&quot;Presently my friend arrived, with his servant, and, as usual, being<br>
surrounded by attendants eager to be of service and assistance. I clung to him<br>
persistently throughout the entire voyage, and he appeared to enjoy my company.<br>
&quot;The first evening out, I visited him in his luxuriously-furnished stateroom,<br>
for he has the best of everything wherever he goes, and while explaining the<br>
wonderful forces that man in his ignorance has permitted to lie dormant within<br>
him, he gave me several demonstrations of the powers that he has developed. He <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 11 -<br>
did things that were actually astounding. He asked, 'Why cannot you do what I do?<br>
Why cannot all do as I do? I have no powers that you are not endowed with. Here<br>
is my answer: Because of my knowledge of Universal Law, I have developed the<br>
God-given powers within me, while you, in your ignorance, have been dissipating<br>
and scattering yours. All men use the same power, for in all the universe there is<br>
but one power. This is self-evident, as you shall see.'<br>
&quot;Continuing, he said: &quot;The great masses of humanity are using the Law<br>
destructively, or partially so, and the scales are balanced against them. Here and<br>
there, among the masses, we find an occasional outstanding figure who has<br>
achieved greatness or success and he is erroneously singled out as lucky or as a<br>
genius, when the fact is that he has made use of the Law - whether knowingly or<br>
unknowingly, it matters not - at least sufficiently to have the scales balanced in his<br>
favor. How plain this is to the one who knows.'<br>
&quot;'Before the discovery of the law governing the use of electricity this great<br>
force was lying dormant throughout the universe, at least as far as man's<br>
knowledge was concerned. He had first to discover the law before he could turn it<br>
to his advantage. Just so with this Universal Law.<br>
&quot;'Happiness is man's rightful heritage. It is the summum bonum (the highest<br>
or chief good - Ed.) of his aspirations. The very soul of man cries out for<br>
happiness, but he misinterprets it in terms of money. Why? Because money is a<br>
means to an end. It is the motive power which drives us on in our quest for the <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 12 -<br>
ultimate, which is happiness. In the world there cannot be happiness without<br>
money. Therefore the occupation of acquiring money is a worthy and<br>
commendable one.<br>
&quot;'Why should man, the supreme creation of the universe, suffer all sorts of<br>
lack, misery and unhappiness when such inferior creatures as the beasts of the<br>
field, the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are bountifully supplied. For any<br>
man, no matter what his station in life, to take the stand that it is the destiny of man<br>
to want for anything that will contribute to his happiness or that of his family is<br>
ridiculous.<br>
&quot;'Somebody discovers the law governing the use of etheric waves and we<br>
have radio. Millions of people are now enjoying its advantages. They tune in to<br>
what they want and they get it. There is a great lesson in this, for believe me, you<br>
may have anything you want and in abundance, when you learn to tune in with an<br>
infinitely greater power than electricity or its vehicle, radio. With a power that you<br>
have had from the beginning.<br>
&quot;'The captain of this ship could just as easily own it as run it. One position is<br>
no more difficult of attainment than the other. He tuned in to the captaincy<br>
successfully. Ownership was a little more distant and he did not try for distance.<br>
That is all. The actual difference in the two positions is merely the difference in<br>
two words. Nothing more, as you shall see very plainly when we get a little further<br>
along.' <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 13 -<br>
&quot;Each night, after retiring to my room, I would sit up until early morning<br>
reading my notes of the day and preparing questions for the next. He told me that I<br>
was very 'receptive' because of my eagerness, sincerity and trust, and that it was a<br>
pleasure to instruct me. And in gratitude I acknowledged that no price was too<br>
high or sacrifice too great in return for such knowledge.<br>
&quot;In answer to my question as to when and how he discovered such a secret,<br>
he said, 'I discovered nothing and to me it is no secret. This knowledge has been in<br>
our family as far back as our records go. I use it because I know it to be the easy,<br>
certain way of accomplishing a purpose, while you have known only the difficult,<br>
uncertain way. He seemed never to want to take credit for anything, always<br>
claiming that no credit was due him.&quot;<br>
&quot;I was rapidly regaining my health and strength and was becoming fired<br>
with an irresistible ambition to get back and start all over again. Censuring myself<br>
for having wasted so many valuable years in fruitless effort in my old way, I was<br>
eager to start in the new way. Approaching the end of our voyage and feeling that<br>
I was soon to part from my great benefactor, to whom I had become greatly<br>
attached and to whom I owed so much, I handed him my card and asked for his, to<br>
which he replied, 'I have no card, no name, no address. I am like the wind. I come<br>
from nowhere and I go everywhere. As for my name, you may call me Friend.'<br>
Saying that I would much prefer to call him Master, he replied, 'No, no, not Master. <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 14 -<br>
Just Friend. That will do.' Glancing at my card, he said, 'I turn up at most<br>
unexpected places. I might be out to see you soon. If I do, I will write you.'<br>
&quot;I shall never forget the parting instructions that he gave me. In a manner<br>
like a parent with a child, he said, 'You are indeed a fortunate man. Just think of<br>
the millions of gifted, highly talented people, many blessed with rare qualities for<br>
success and leadership whose achievements would mean so much to their fellow<br>
men and happiness and contentment to themselves and their families who do not<br>
know what you know. But who go on striving and straining, wasting their precious<br>
life force, only to find themselves dissatisfied, discouraged, disheartened, crushed,<br>
as you once were, yet spurred on by that divine spark, that irresistible urge within<br>
by which they instinctively realize that there is a way but which they, in their<br>
ignorance, misinterpret and consequently find themselves failures after years of<br>
despairing effort.<br>
&quot;'All this you can now avoid. Go home. You have learned all that you will<br>
need. If you will diligently follow the instructions that I have given, you may<br>
reach any heights. You may accomplish any worthy purpose easily and quickly.<br>
There need be no limit to your possibilities. Your successes will multiply and<br>
increase in proportion to your mastery of the Law. With each success your faith in<br>
the Law grows stronger until you reach the point of conviction. Then you are<br>
invincible. <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 15 -<br>
&quot;'Bear in mind the warning that I have repeatedly given you. Reveal nothing<br>
of this to even your dearest friend. To do so before you are powerfully fortified in<br>
the Law would only tend to interfere with your plans, but particularly, it would<br>
result in the scattering of your forces and consequently weaken their power for<br>
your good. Therefore, keep your secret securely locked within your heart. You<br>
will never be able to work out another's problems. Neither will another be able to<br>
work out yours. This is strictly a matter for each individual. Accomplishment of<br>
anything, in any line, is the result of the operation of this inner force, discovered<br>
and set to work, and this must be done by each one for himself. There is no other<br>
way.<br>
&quot;'When the time arrives that you shall have retired from commercial<br>
pursuits, you may, after seeking the guidance of your conscience, release it for the<br>
benefit of others. Thus liberated from further commercial allurements, you will be<br>
free to devote your life to the uplift of your fellow man, lending your help to<br>
freeing him from the bondage of want, misery and unhappiness.'<br>
&quot;Reluctantly parting with my benefactor as he entered a taxi with his servant<br>
and gave directions to his hotel, I started down the street unconscious of the<br>
crowds and with such a peculiar sensation of exaltation and buoyancy that I<br>
seemed to be just floating along rather than walking. Sleep had no attraction for<br>
me and it was with difficulty that I induced myself to retire to a hotel. <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 16 -<br>
&quot;On the train speeding home I carefully avoided all unnecessary contact with<br>
my fellow passengers. I kept to my stateroom. Oh, how I wanted to be alone and<br>
to think. I could not think of sparing any of my precious time for worthless, idle<br>
conversation and gossip. How useless it seemed to me now, when there was so<br>
much to be accomplished. I was just dominated by the one compelling purpose to<br>
try out my new teaching and not another day could be wasted. Nothing else<br>
interested me and nothing else mattered.<br>
&quot;There you have as much of my story as I am at liberty to reveal at this time,<br>
and I give you this much in the hope that it will encourage you to such an extent<br>
that you will consider any personal sacrifice well worth the price of such<br>
knowledge. For years I have been blindly seeking what I never imagined existed,<br>
and now that I have it, no fortune is large enough to buy it.&quot;<br>
Noticing upon me the appalling effect of his inability to enlighten me<br>
further, Dave attempted to ease my feelings with the assurance that he would see<br>
that I got in touch with the Master upon his arrival. This only intensified my<br>
determination as I excitedly exclaimed, &quot;I'll never wait for an arrival that might<br>
never occur. By the gods I'll find him if you will give me the name of his hotel.&quot;<br>
So different from his former excitable nature, he remained calm and poised as he<br>
replied that he had not overheard the name. <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 17 -<br>
There was nothing for me to do now but settle down as best I could to<br>
impatiently waiting and hoping while he immediately plunged into his former<br>
occupation, that of operating in the market. Because of his secretiveness we knew<br>
little of his affairs, although we met him a few times at the club. On such<br>
occasions, none of us seemed to have the courage to question him regarding<br>
himself and he talked on every subject but that. However, it was but a short time<br>
until his activities reached such proportions that he was compelled to carry on his<br>
operations to some extent through a few of his close friends, including myself. It<br>
was then that I learned in part the magnitude of them.<br>
Fearing that such successes could not last, I attempted to advise greater<br>
caution, warning him that some day his bubble would burst and then where would<br>
he be. With a quick turn toward me, and with his characteristic dominant<br>
expression, he replied, &quot;Tom, you need have no concern about my welfare. I<br>
operate according to definite unerring law. If you want to get the square feet<br>
contained in this room, you would get the two dimensions, and following a process<br>
laid down by the law of mathematics, you would arrive at a definite result. You<br>
would be certain of the success of the process from the beginning. Just so with my<br>
work. I know the outcome before I start.&quot; That was the last mention I ever made<br>
to him of his affairs and he never referred to them.<br>
There seemed to be no stopping to him, for he went on from one success to<br>
another. His perpetual energy and vitality seemed to never lag and the dynamic <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 18 -<br>
force with which he seemed to dominate every situation and overwhelm all<br>
opposition to his progress was actually superhuman. At the few social gatherings<br>
which he attended, his magnetic personality and the mystery with which his name<br>
was associated made him the center of attention.<br>
Because of his desire to avoid notice, I saw little of him for some time and<br>
hearing no news of the Master, I had just about become resigned to my fate when<br>
one day his secretary telephoned that there was a letter at his office which would<br>
interest me. Hurrying over, I was handed a letter, written on the stationery of a<br>
prominent hotel and addressed to him, which read: &quot;Detained by important affairs.<br>
Regret to have to forego a visit with you this time.&quot; And signed, &quot;Your Friend.&quot;<br>
At last my chance had come. The hotel was my only clue, but it was<br>
enough. Hastily getting my three interested associates together, we left, and that<br>
evening found us speeding eastward in our quest of the Master and the &quot;secret.&quot;<br>
Entering the hotel, upon our arrival, I went direct to the manager and informed him<br>
of our mission. He knew immediately and told me that because of the many<br>
visitors who were crowding the Master, he had departed, leaving no address. He<br>
had no further information to give us.<br>
Again I was thoroughly disheartened. Was I ever to learn that &quot;secret?&quot; I<br>
really believed that I was not. However, we got a good description of him and<br>
decided to continue our search. We separated in order to work more effectively,<br>
but our search was without success until the night of the fifth day. I sat alone in <br>
The Magic Story - Part I - by John McDonald<br>
- 19 -<br>
the lobby of our hotel that night after my associates had retired, following an hour<br>
of argument in an effort to persuade me to return home. I decided that I would not<br>
give up. I would continue the search forever, if necessary.<br>
Sitting there in a deserted corner at that hour in the early morning my<br>
feelings suddenly changed from utter despondency to joyous elation. Somehow, I<br>
knew that my search was at an end and while pondering over this I became<br>
possessed of a sense of some presence behind me. Immediately - a hand touched<br>
my shoulder. I arose, turned, and there before me, I looked into the most<br>
magnificent face that I have ever seen. And the eyes! They sparkled like jewels.<br>
And a voice said, &quot;Are you looking for me?&quot; I merely answered, &quot;I am,&quot; for I<br>
knew it was he.<br>
I will not go into his explanation of the causes which led up to our meeting,<br>
but after a long talk, during which he explained that his time was so busily<br>
occupied that there was no way in which he could give any instructions; that he<br>
was not even receiving visitors during this short visit to this country, but that he<br>
would advise me of his next visit, I vehemently exclaimed with all the intensity of<br>
my being that I was desperately in need of him; that we had come thousands of<br>
miles to learn his wisdom and that I was willing to sacrifice anything for just a<br>
little of his knowledge. My desperation and the intensity of my appeal must have<br>
aroused his compassion, for he agreed to receive us for instructions the following<br>
morning at his apartment. <br>

PART II<br>
The Message of a Master<br>
The sight that met our eyes as we entered his apartment that morning will<br>
stand out vividly in my memory. Never before or since have I seen such<br>
luxuriance and extravagance displayed as in the furnishings of that place. It<br>
seemed like desecration to tread upon those magnificent silk rugs as we were led<br>
by his servant through a room delicately perfumed by an abundance of flowers<br>
artistically arranged, to a room which appeared to be his study and where chairs<br>
had already been placed for us.<br>
His entry immediately after was followed by a round of introductions,<br>
names, occupations and general remarks. We had expected to see him attired in<br>
some gorgeous style in keeping with his surroundings, but were struck by the<br>
simplicity in both his dress and his bearing. My impression was that being<br>
conscious of his power, he preferred to shun publicity and people rather than be the<br>
object of any attention and he explained the presence of the furnishings by saying<br>
that he loved beautiful things and therefore surrounded himself with them.<br>
He began our instructions by saying:<br>
You may have come here in expectation of seeing a mysterious being<br>
endowed with mystic powers. A sort of magician who can pull a fortune out of the<br>
air and pass it over to you. You have very much misled yourselves. I am just an<br>
ordinary man, no different than you are. The world calls such as me, a Master.<br>
And so I am, but only in the sense that I have learned how to master environment <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 22 -<br>
and conditions. That I have developed in me the powers that abide alike in all of<br>
us and that I am more nearly living life as it should be lived.<br>
I realize that you have come here because of your faith in me and that you<br>
look upon me somewhat as an exalted personality. But in order that you may gain<br>
the greatest benefit from these teachings I will ask that you wipe out any<br>
impression that you may have of me as a personality. I assure you that I am<br>
worthy of no honor or homage. I am just a human like yourself. I am not a<br>
superior being. Rather I am a humble being, thankful for the knowledge that I<br>
have gained. I made no discoveries. I received these instructions in much the<br>
same manner that I am about to give them to you.<br>
You will find no difficulty in putting these principles into practice in your<br>
everyday affairs. They are as available to you as to me, for this great Law is no<br>
respecter of persons. It is the highest and most effective possible in worldly affairs<br>
and is well worth learning, for its practice results in a life that is well worth living.<br>
Employing these principles wisely and intelligently, there can be no<br>
uncertainty as to the outcome of any undertaking and no limit to your possibilities.<br>
As you go on and on, your confidence increases and you find that your powers are<br>
increasing. You accomplish greater things with greater ease and greater speed. As<br>
its growth in you increases, your accomplishments increase likewise.<br>
With many, remarkable improvement comes quickly as in the case of your<br>
friend who is responsible for you being here today. With others, the growth is<br>
more gradual. The difference is not any difference in the individual, for all are<br>
endowed with the same capacity, but it is a difference in the degree of intensity<br>
employed. However, no man could ever receive these instructions and not become<br>
a better man because of them.<br>
No great things are accomplished in the consciousness of personality. That<br>
is impossible, for personality is limiting. Therefore, accept these lessons for just<br>
what they mean to you alone as an individual entity. Let not my presence or your <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 23 -<br>
impression of me influence you in any way in your studies. Learn from my words<br>
only, not from me. Now let us proceed:<br>
In imparting the principles of this law to you, I will ask that you overlook<br>
any apparent contradictions, for, of necessity, they are bound to occur when<br>
treating upon a subject of this kind in order that propositions otherwise obscure<br>
may be made clear. And again, you must understand that I am using your language<br>
to convey my meaning and I meet with some difficulty in doing so. I want you to<br>
bear in mind this advice:<br>
Take these teachings for just what they mean to you individually. If some<br>
statements do not appeal to you at this time, make no effort to force yourself to<br>
accept them. What you might reject or fail to understand now will no doubt appear<br>
plain and become valuable to you later, as your capacity to receive increases.<br>
There are times when the changing of words makes a subject more clear or<br>
appealing to people of different mentalities. Therefore, if you find that the<br>
replacing of my words for your own at times makes any statement clearer or seems<br>
to fit in with your particular mental make-up or belief, you may do so freely.<br>
He who is wise in his own conceit, who approaches a subject in an attitude<br>
of doubt and resistance, will learn little. There is not much hope for him. But he<br>
who takes up any subject in an open mind, willing to learn anything that will<br>
contribute to his advancement, comfort and happiness, is wise.<br>
Therefore, while I do not ask that you believe all that I tell you, for to do so<br>
would be to intrude upon your God-given freedom of thought, yet neither do I wish<br>
you to doubt or resist what I tell you, for that would prevent you from gaining the<br>
help you are seeking. For your own highest and greatest good, your attitude should<br>
be just this: I am going to take these teachings in an open-minded, neutral attitude,<br>
determined that I shall gain all the benefit there is in them for me. The fact that I<br>
do not understand or even believe any particular statement or proposition at this<br>
time, does not necessarily make it any the less true. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>

To be able to make use of the Law as outlined, it is necessary that you have a<br>
clear understanding of its operation. To this end, I will illustrate, wherever<br>
possible, the different propositions with examples in nature that you will find all<br>
about you and that will help you in reasoning out these truths to a logical<br>
conclusion.<br>
Your mind, which is yourself, can be likened to a house which the<br>
accumulation of years has cluttered with the thousands of unnecessary pieces of<br>
furniture, pictures, ornaments and other things, all strewn around and heaped<br>
everywhere, with the result that while the outside of that house might present a<br>
good appearance, the inside is a mass of confusion and disorder. How utterly<br>
impossible to accomplish anything under such conditions, for you cannot go after<br>
one thing without stumbling over another. No order. No purpose. No progress.<br>
The first necessary move, then is to rid that house of all but the furnishings<br>
essential to success.<br>
The Great Universal Law Which Makes Us<br>
Absolute Masters of Conditions<br>
and Environment<br>
How did you get here? You grew from a minute cell smaller than the point<br>
of a pin. Just think! A cell or seed the size of a pin point contained within itself in<br>
essence and in entirety, the wonderful being that you are today.<br>
Surely, that cell could not possibly contain the material forms, no matter<br>
how infinitesimal they might be, of body, head, hair, arms, legs, hands, feet and all<br>
the wonderful organs of the body.<br>
Well, then, how did you arrive at your full stature as you now appear? There<br>
is but one logical answer -- that cell contained a spark of Mind, the one and only <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 25 -<br>
power supreme in man. That spark of mind, true to the law of its own being, held a<br>
fixed image or picture of you and you unfolded, grew and eventually out-pictured<br>
or became objectified in obedience to that law.<br>
Surely, you cannot reasonably deny that, in the process of nature, you<br>
originated in a cell. And you will not deny that you could not be contained bodily<br>
in that cell. Therefore, the only conclusion is, that you must have been in that cell<br>
mentally.<br>
Should your understanding fail to immediately grasp this truth, your<br>
reasoning faculty will readily admit that there is a power at work in that cell<br>
unfolding according to a definite plan. So intelligence must be present. Admitting<br>
the presence of intelligence, it follows that we must admit of the presence of mind.<br>
It is necessary at this point to get one fact clearly before you, for it is the<br>
fundamental basis from which we proceed, and that clearly is this: that Mind, no<br>
matter what form it is apparently contained in, holds images, pictures. And any<br>
picture firmly held in any mind, in any form, is bound to come forth.<br>
This is the great, unchanging Universal Law which, when we co-operate<br>
with it intelligently, makes us absolute masters of conditions and environment.<br>
Can you not recall instances when you have secretly expressed a desire<br>
within yourself for some particular thing or that you might meet a particular<br>
person, when, shortly, that thing becomes your possession or that person appears,<br>
and you might exclaim: &quot;Isn't it a coincidence! I was thinking of you just this<br>
morning?&quot; It is no coincidence at all. Not at all strange. It was the natural<br>
outcome of the operation of definite law.<br>
If this be true, why do not all wishes or thoughts appear? Many do, but<br>
because of the absence of alertness, due to ignorance of the law, they pass<br>
unnoticed. And again, many do not manifest at all. To illustrate this, I can use<br>
your knowledge of radio. You attempt to tune in to one station for some delightful<br>
music, but because of there being a number of others on the air, your reward is a <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 26 -<br>
jumble of confusion. But should you reach that station when others are<br>
temporarily off, you get it clearly and your desire is gratified.<br>
The answer to the question is this: It happened that, by chance, those<br>
thoughts or desires which appeared arose at just the instant when there were no<br>
other conflicting thoughts present to nullify their power, and the mind, instead of<br>
being divided among many thoughts, threw its great force in with the one and it<br>
became out-pictured or externalized.<br>
You have experienced times when your mind became a complete blank for<br>
just a moment and you found yourself staring out into space. If at that instant it<br>
were possible to inject any wish, any desire, with sufficient force, nothing upon<br>
earth could prevent it from coming forth instantly.<br>
Now, what is the cause of the confusion prevailing in mind which weakens<br>
your thought? It is the false belief that there is a power or powers outside of you<br>
greater than the power within you. If through a system of practice, conditions<br>
within you became such, that every constructive thought automatically outpictured,<br>
you would be master of all conditions or circumstances that in any way<br>
concerned you or affected your life. Would you not?<br>
You Are All Powerful Mind<br>
The next step in your instructions is this: The consciousness or fixed picture<br>
in mind of anything, any condition, any circumstance, is the actual thing itself and<br>
what you experience through the five senses is the mental picture out-pictured, or<br>
made visible or tangible identically the same as the artist who puts his mental<br>
pictures upon the canvas; the hand, in his case, being merely the instrument<br>
through which the mind expresses and which is under the guidance and direction of<br>
the mind. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 27 -<br>
Does not medical science agree that the human body undergoes a complete<br>
change every eleven months? This means that the cells of which your entire body<br>
is composed die and are passed off at such a rate that you do not possess as little as<br>
one cell of the body you had a year ago. You remember many years back, do you<br>
not? Many happenings of your childhood can be recalled to memory. How can<br>
you remember back through those many years when your brain is not yet a year<br>
old? Because you are mind. You are not body.<br>
As an individual entity, functioning in an individual sphere, which is true of<br>
each one of us, you are all-powerful Mind and your body is the vehicle through<br>
which you function. You are master and your body is your servant. It is your<br>
instrument of expression. That is all.<br>
Now, which is the real body -- the one that remains pictured or imaged<br>
forever in mind as long as you exist here, or the one that decays in its entirety and<br>
passes into the earth every eleven months? And which are the real things -- those<br>
things imaged or pictured in mind, or those things seen in the outer and which<br>
disintegrate after a short existence?<br>
Right here I do not wish to have you misled into the impression that the<br>
outer is of little or no importance in human achievement, but it is only secondary,<br>
while a fundamental knowledge of the operation of mind is of primary importance<br>
to you at the start.<br>
I wish it were possible to explain, so that you might understand, the process<br>
by which a picture in mind becomes objectified, but it would require hours to even<br>
make an effort in this direction, and then I might only confuse you. For words are<br>
feeble things when one attempts to explain these deeper things of Universal Law.<br>
One really must gradually and patiently advance up to and into them to understand.<br>
However, it is not necessary to know this in order to use the law any more than it is<br>
necessary to know the law by which the sun's rays are transmitted to earth in order<br>
to enjoy them. You have faith in my sincerity of purpose. Very well, place the <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 28 -<br>
same amount of faith in the power of this law and anything you undertake will be<br>
possible of accomplishment. Let us get on to the next step. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 29 -<br>
How We Daily Waste Our Own<br>
Wonderful Powers<br>
You may have heard it said that there are many minds, but such a statement<br>
is merely an idiom. There is nothing in science or reality to support such a<br>
predicate. There is but one mind, as there is but one electricity, one air or<br>
atmosphere. The many minds referred to are but a multiplicity of expressions of<br>
the one. We use mind as we use air or electricity -- as our individual needs require.<br>
I will now ask that you bear with me for a time while I make use of a<br>
contradiction in order that I may simplify the next subject. It becomes necessary<br>
for me to refer to three minds, or, properly speaking, three phases of mind.<br>
You are apparently made up of three minds. The one which controls the<br>
functioning of the body and which, for want of a better word, I will call the Deeper<br>
mind. This mind we are not particularly concerned with, and properly should not<br>
be. It knows its duties better than we do. We can co-operate with this mind to our<br>
great profit in both health and strength by keeping our thoughts off the body. By<br>
forgetting that we have a body and thereby refraining from interfering with the<br>
proper functioning of this Deeper mind, we will find that it will get along very<br>
nicely.<br>
The other two minds in which we are greatly interested and with which we<br>
must deal from this time forth, are what I might name the Inner and Outer minds.<br>
Those two minds you will readily recognize from the fact that when you take<br>
sides within yourself upon a subject and find yourself carrying on a spirited<br>
controversy with yourself, you are engaging these two minds.<br>
The proper office of the Outer mind, which is in touch with external things<br>
through the medium of the five senses, is to transmit its desires to the Inner mind,<br>
which is the seat of power within you and which, by its very nature, has no<br>
consciousness of duality, since it has no faculty of discrimination. It knows no <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 30 -<br>
impossible, no failure, no obstacle, or limit or lack. It depends upon the guidance<br>
of the Outer mind and throws its great, unlimited force into anything that the Outer<br>
mind may direct.<br>
I can better illustrate the character of the Inner mind by again comparing it<br>
with atomic energy. As atomic energy is the greatest power in the world, so is the<br>
Inner mind the greatest power in your being. Of themselves, neither operate<br>
independently, but depend upon a separate agency to incite them to action, and<br>
both bring helpful or harmful results according to the wisdom or ignorance with<br>
which they are directed.<br>
This being true, how important, then for the Outer to unite with the Inner<br>
and co-operate with it, and if this were the condition in human affairs, man would<br>
be master of his environment instead of being the slave of circumstance.<br>
Why are all not super-men instead of merely men? For this reason: The<br>
Outer Mind forms a desire which is automatically taken up by the Inner mind and,<br>
in turn, it immediately proceeds to function toward bringing it forth. It scarcely<br>
has time to turn its great force in that direction before the Outer has found a new<br>
fancy or has conjured up illusionary obstacles, and the Inner, not being on the<br>
surface, not in contact with outer things and consequently dependent upon the<br>
Outer for guidance, is forced to again divert its power. And thus it goes, on and<br>
on, like leaks in a steam pipe, scattering its wonderful power everywhere but<br>
getting nowhere.<br>
Why is the Inner mind thus thwarted in every move it makes toward<br>
accomplishment? Why? Because the Outer judges everything by what the eye and<br>
ear reports and transmits that message to the Inner.<br>
What do we find humanity doing? We find them taking pictures of what<br>
they experience daily in the outer world, developing the sensitized film, then<br>
printing those pictures upon themselves within. The procedure should be just the<br>
reverse. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 31 -<br>
I know whereof I speak when I say that we have been endowed with the<br>
capacity and the power to create desirable pictures within and to find them<br>
automatically printed in the outer world of our environment. And it is a simple<br>
process, as you will see later. When we can do this, we have mastery. And not<br>
before.<br>
Well, then, you would say, the need must be to discipline the Outer mind,<br>
since it seems to be the offender. Just so. But since it meets up with thousands of<br>
experiences almost daily, ordinary methods of training might require years to<br>
accomplish results. Or, at best, such training would be a long-drawn-out process.<br>
There is a quicker and better way. A method which, when put into operation,<br>
employs the usefulness of the Outer mind without taking into account its<br>
vacillating willfulness. And the first step in this direction follows:<br>
Definite Goal Disciplines Outer Mind<br>
We will suppose that there is an urgent need for you to reach a certain town<br>
as quickly as possible. When you step into your car, you naturally picture in mind<br>
a given point of destination and turn your face in that direction. If that point be<br>
distant, you may become diverted onto wrong roads many times, but upon noting<br>
this, you return and again take the proper course, guided by what? -- by the picture<br>
in mind of the place you are headed for, and you get there.<br>
You held to a set definite objective until you reached it. You held your<br>
objective or destination in mind without any particular effort or strain and merely<br>
returned the car to the proper road when you found that it had strayed, and you got<br>
there. Thus it is with us. A set definite objective must be established if we are to<br>
accomplish anything in a big way.<br>
What do I mean by establishing a set definite objective? Is it as simple as it<br>
sounds? No, not at the start. Would you set your objective at a million <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 32 -<br>
immediately and start out thoughtlessly to make it overnight? Yes, you might, if<br>
you have the capacity to see a million as an immediate possibility. But this is quite<br>
rare. The wise thing to do is to grow to it as the marathon runner begins by first<br>
running a mile. Then he goes two miles, then three. Thus he expands his capacity<br>
to eventually cover the full distance.<br>
Why is a set definite objective necessary? There are three reasons.<br>
First--The Inner mind is the positive pole of your being, while the Outer is<br>
the negative pole, as in geology the North Pole is the positive and the South Pole<br>
the negative. There must be a positive and negative in everything in the universe<br>
in order to complete a circuit or circle, without which there would be no activity,<br>
no motion. To illustrate this, there would be no forward if we had no backward.<br>
There would be no up if there were no down. There never could have been such a<br>
quality as good if there were no evil, so called. How could there have been light<br>
without darkness? For us to be conscious of one thing, there must be another<br>
opposite by which to compare it or it remains non-existent to us.<br>
Now, in everything that is obedient to Law, the positive dominates and<br>
governs and the negative serves. But mankind reverses this. The Outer mind looks<br>
out upon the world and reports strife, competition, obstacles, impossibilities and<br>
similar conditions. Why? Because of the absence of direction, it is left to wander<br>
without a purpose and thus, aimlessly wandering, it accepts everything.<br>
The set definite objective, firmly imaged or pictured in mind, immediately<br>
whips the Outer into line by giving it a fixed duty to perform. This, automatically,<br>
without any effort on your part, infuses into it the positive quality of the Inner<br>
mind, and since the law of the universe and, therefore, also of your being, cannot<br>
change, negative conditions, including individuals, serve it and therefore you. And<br>
again, automatically, positive conditions and individuals are attracted to you as<br>
surely as the steel particles are attracted to the magnet. That is the first reason. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 33 -<br>
Second--The atmosphere, or ether, as we prefer to name it, is filled with<br>
millions upon millions of thoughts which are forever in motion. The thousands of<br>
stations in your country, all broadcasting simultaneously, give you a slight idea of<br>
the thoughts in the air. Every human being is a broadcasting station and everybody<br>
is a receiving set. This explains why I am able to answer your questions instantly,<br>
before you have had to form them into words. The fact that I have been getting<br>
your thoughts before you have expressed them and which have been puzzling you,<br>
is now made clear. This is a faculty developed after years of training. This faculty<br>
was always in me and is within you. I have brought out and made use of mine,<br>
while yours lies dormant almost entirely.<br>
To get back to our subject. The man who has no set definite objective is<br>
tuning in to everything and getting nothing. He is unfortunate indeed, for he is at<br>
the mercy of millions of conflicting thoughts and his is a life of confusion and<br>
distress. Some of those in my work have so perfected themselves that they are able<br>
to see these thoughts by virtue of the same law developed in themselves, by which<br>
you enjoy television. Therefore, we know what we are talking about when we<br>
speak of the chaos of thoughts in the air.<br>
On the other hand, the man who has a set definite objective deliberately<br>
tunes in to one thing, which action automatically makes him positive and<br>
consequently wipes out the others. If it is money he wants, he gets it. If it is<br>
position he wants, he gets it. Nothing that such a man tunes in to can be withheld<br>
from him.<br>
Third--When you set your mind upon anything, whether it be small or large,<br>
a pencil, a hat, automobile, a home or great riches; whether it be tangible like these<br>
or intangible, such as an education, a profession or travel, you transfer a portion of<br>
your life force to that thing, or how could it be otherwise drawn to you? And you<br>
continue to nourish it as long as it is held in mind, and the intensity of your desire<br>
governs the power with which the force is directed. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 34 -<br>
So you can see that were even a positive man to direct his force at several<br>
objectives, that force becomes divided and each objective receives but a feeble<br>
stimulus, resulting in slow reaction or none at all. Have you a great ultimate goal<br>
to reach requiring the attainment of lesser objectives on the way? Well, then, let<br>
the many lie inactive and direct your force at the nearest or first, and that being<br>
accomplished, take up the next and thus follow on as they occur in sequential<br>
order.<br>
Have I now given you the Law in its entirety? Well, in a sense, I have.<br>
Then again, I have not. To instruct one as to what to do is good, but to show one<br>
how to do it is better. It is not only necessary that we learn how to attain, but we<br>
must also learn how to maintain. I will, therefore, go further and give you an<br>
important requirement in successful achievement and that is secretiveness.<br>
Man Who Uses Mind Power<br>
Will Be Supreme<br>
Before I explain the value of Secretiveness, I will have to change from our<br>
subject at hand for a while.<br>
When you declare &quot;I am,&quot; &quot;I will,&quot; &quot;I did,&quot; you are making a most mighty<br>
and profound utterance. There are very few who realize the power released when<br>
the &quot;I&quot; is expressed. Hear the great proclamation, &quot;I AM THAT I AM,&quot; from the<br>
lips of the Prophet, which has lived and rung out down the ages and which, when<br>
understood, unites each one with that impersonal, universal power.<br>
The body you have is personal, but the &quot;I&quot; you express is universal, for in all<br>
the universe there is but one &quot;I,&quot; as in all the universe there is but one figure &quot;1.&quot;<br>
The other figures are but multiples or derivatives of that &quot;1.&quot; The figure &quot;7,&quot; for <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 35 -<br>
instance, is the &quot;1&quot; repeated so many times. It is the understanding of those in my<br>
work that the &quot;I&quot; is the root from which the figure &quot;1&quot; has sprung.<br>
From what I have said, you should be able to see this: That when you work<br>
in the &quot;me&quot; consciousness (Outer mind), you are working from the personal,<br>
limited standpoint. When you work in the &quot;I&quot; consciousness (Inner mind), you<br>
invoke and receive the help of the impersonal, unlimited resources of the universe.<br>
Well, you ask, &quot;How am I to arrive at this state?&quot; Easily, I will say. For by merely<br>
following the system of practice that I am outlining, you naturally gravitate into it<br>
unknowingly.<br>
Now listen attentively: If there is but one &quot;I&quot; and you cannot express<br>
yourself without using it, it follows that as far as you individually are concerned,<br>
there must be but one &quot;you.&quot; You do not get this clearly? Well, did you ever apply<br>
the pronoun &quot;I&quot; to any other human being? Of course you did not. You could not.<br>
You might say &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; &quot;they,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; but never &quot;I.&quot; For there is but one<br>
&quot;I&quot; and that is you. And I say there is but one &quot;you.&quot; Yes, applied individually,<br>
there is but one &quot;you.&quot; We will suppose that through a slight accident, you were to<br>
be rendered unconscious for five minutes. During that period the world would<br>
cease to exist. It would be absolutely wiped out. But, you will say, it would go on<br>
just the same. Yes, but without your consciousness of it, it is not; it is non-existent.<br>
Proving that there is but one You.<br>
Since the great and mighty &quot;I&quot; is, when expressed individually, none other<br>
than yourself, you can see what power you have at your command. You can see<br>
what a wonderful being you are. You can see that you are now a master, not yet<br>
developed perhaps, but the qualities are there awaiting unfoldment and use.<br>
If you do not clearly understand what I have just given, pass it by for this<br>
time and let us go on to the next. You can later reason it out for yourself and see<br>
the truth of it. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 36 -<br>
You might question the value of such detailed explanation, but I have a<br>
purpose and that purpose is to force you to think, to think deeply, with intensity.<br>
Right here I would not have you confuse the word intensity with tenseness.<br>
Tenseness implies mental strain and arises out of fear and anxiety. It is destructive<br>
to both mind and body. My use of intensity here suggests mental force or power<br>
and its results are constructive.<br>
You know thus far that progress depends upon the degree of sustained<br>
intensity in a given direction. And you know that progress is very rapid these days.<br>
We must travel as rapidly as the world or give up, and when we give up we<br>
immediately begin to retrograde. To enjoy enduring success we should travel a<br>
little in advance of the world.<br>
The persistent inner urge in the race of mind to reach an objective more<br>
speedily, eventually crystallized and out-pictured itself in the form of an<br>
automobile, which was the first big step in fast transportation for general use. But<br>
since it is the nature of Mind to forever reach out for greater achievement, the<br>
airplane came into being in obedience to the mind of man to find a way faster and<br>
not subject to the obstacles incident to automobile travel. And thus Mind moves<br>
and thus it will move forever.<br>
Open your eyes and look about you. Cannot you discern the trend? Mind is<br>
forever reaching out and has not stopped at jet aircraft as a rapid mode of travel. I<br>
hesitate to tell you what the next great step in this direction will be, but I will tell<br>
you this: Mind is so rapidly coming into its own, that in the not far distant future,<br>
the man who knows the law and uses it will be supreme and the ignorant one who<br>
refuses to see this will just remain in bondage to his false beliefs. How important,<br>
then, to learn the law of thinking things through rather than follow the time-worn<br>
method of attempting to force them through. One is mastery and the other slavery.<br>
Returning to the subject, the value of secretiveness lies in the fact that, being<br>
impersonal and universal, the &quot;I&quot; throws its power in with whatever words it is <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 37 -<br>
coupled, and when your plans are expressed in words verbally, they become<br>
released and their force is spent. The Outer mind has found a way of escape and<br>
your purpose has lost its necessary momentum.<br>
Riches, Health and Happiness Through<br>
Cooperation with the Law of Your Being<br>
The next requisite I might term your Nourishment or Reserve. We know<br>
that few are capable of sustained effort, and that is the reason why we have<br>
comparatively few outstanding successes. You have learned that your great power<br>
lies not upon the surface but deep within your being, in your Inner mind. The<br>
average human lives upon the surface, ignorant of his great interior power. Placing<br>
what little faith he has in the Outer mind, he is governed by its false reports, and as<br>
a result he is constantly in a turmoil of confusion, strife and strain until he<br>
succumbs, discouraged and disheartened, broken in health and spirit.<br>
Why is this so? Why is it a common expression that a man who accumulates<br>
wealth pays dearly for it in health and vitality? Because, as I have already told<br>
you, when he intensifies upon a given objective, he automatically transfers to it a<br>
portion of his vital life force. This is all very well and necessary, but such a<br>
practice continued, with no replenishment to keep that life force nourished, drains<br>
it and the result is trouble.<br>
It is your rightful heritage, your birthright, to have anything that you desire<br>
and without limit, for, as I have said, you are in a sense the only one here, for yours<br>
is the only consciousness in existence as far as you are concerned. You can never<br>
know another. Those things that you desire were put here for you to use and enjoy.<br>
If not, why are they here? And since only you can be conscious of your own<br>
individual desires, those things were placed here specifically for you. <br>

Yes, you may have riches and position and with them health and happiness,<br>
when you know the law of your being and cooperate with it. I have no patience<br>
with the one who proclaims that poverty is a blessing. Poverty is the greatest curse<br>
upon earth. The one who preaches such a doctrine is untrue to himself, for, while<br>
such remarks are proceeding from his lips, the desire for the good things of life is<br>
gnawing at his heart.<br>
Knowing so well that each individual, being differently constituted, given<br>
the fundamental principles of the Law, will each work it out somewhat differently,<br>
according to his own particular inherent nature, I have purposely avoided referring<br>
to my method, so that you might have your entire freedom of interpretation and<br>
decision. But since I feel prompted to do so, I will give you a hint of how I work,<br>
advising that you let this not influence or change you in your method, because of it<br>
having come from me. You cannot attain dominion patterning after another, or<br>
following custom or tradition. Sheep and plodders do that. Masters and leaders<br>
never do.<br>
A painting would be a dull, uninteresting thing were the artist, in featuring a<br>
great oak tree, to fail to include its natural surroundings of grass, brush, flowers,<br>
leaves, and possibly sky and clouds. The true artist creates a faithful reproduction.<br>
Our methods are similar. While he places his upon the canvas, I place mine within.<br>
He places the oak upon the canvas and gives it its natural surroundings. I do the<br>
same. To bring his picture forth, he is compelled to concentrate upon it to the<br>
exclusion of all else that would tend to draw him away from his purpose. So am I.<br>
At times something in the external suggests the picture to him. At other times<br>
inspiration suggests it. It is the same with me. A hundred things in a day may<br>
come up to distract him and attempt to draw him away, but with his picture<br>
uppermost, he does not resist those distractions, but gives them their due attention<br>
and returns to the picture. Just so with me. His picture completed, he begins <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>

another. I also do. For I am never consciously, mentally inactive. Inactivity is<br>
retrogression.<br>
Should I desire the presence of my servant at this moment, I would see him<br>
before me in my mind picture surrounded by what is within my vision here and<br>
shortly the picture out-pictures.<br>
Were I to desire wealth, I would surround that picture with all of wealth's<br>
natural accompaniments of conditions and possessions that would instinctively<br>
present themselves for inclusion. I would get my suggestions, if necessary, from<br>
the out-picturing or externalized picture of another's success. I would go about my<br>
duties as usual. It matters little what I appear to be doing in the outer. It matters<br>
much what I am doing within.<br>
If I were a beginner and desired, for instance, a new car or home, I would<br>
select a picture in colors of the one or closely resembling the one I desired, from a<br>
magazine, and place it where it would meet my eyes frequently. This would tend<br>
to hold the Outer mind in line and hasten the out-picturing of my idea.<br>

After the day's activities devoted to your ordinary duties and affairs and the<br>
consequent devitalization of your life force, more or less, it is well to set apart an<br>
hour or half hour, as your judgment might dictate, each evening when you can be<br>
alone and undisturbed, and in the quiet and stillness of your own being, take each<br>
word separately down the list, or if you feel so disposed, select such words from<br>
the list as you feel your particular needs require at the time. Firmly impress your<br>
being with each word and at the same time, interpreting its meaning and its effect<br>
upon you, not necessarily in the terms of its generally accepted meaning, but<br>
strictly as it appeals to you.<br>
Although I am continually impressing you with the fact that you are the &quot;I,&quot;<br>
the power in your world, and that you are to stand upon your own two feet firmly<br>
and live it--not particularly display it, but live it--(great characters shrink from<br>
display and publicity because of the littleness of it). Yet I do not advise that the<br>
declaration &quot;I am&quot; be used in connection with these words unless you are at the<br>
time in a positive frame of mind; unless you have a full conviction of what you are<br>
repeating.<br>
To declare, for example, &quot;I am Power,&quot; lays the Inner mind open to attack<br>
from the Outer in the form of denial or doubt. Whereas, when the words only are<br>
repeated, they do not take upon themselves the nature of a declaration, and<br>
consequently the Outer mind has not been given the opportunity to become aroused<br>
in opposition. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 41 -<br>
To simplify explanation of your right attitude during this practice, I might<br>
say that keeping your thoughts off the body and off external affairs and things,<br>
automatically places you in the ideal mood. Of course, the Outer mind will wander<br>
and bring up hundreds of things, hundreds of times, but like the automobile that I<br>
mentioned becoming diverted on to the wrong road, you bring it back and bring it<br>
back, each time setting it on the right road. This wandering propensity of the Outer<br>
mind will gradually lessen during these periods and you will find yourself<br>
becoming a master of concentration.<br>
There should be no strain, striving, anxiety or concern connected with this<br>
practice. You devote each evening, unless otherwise taken up by occasional<br>
business, social or family duties, to allowing these words to sink in and penetrate<br>
your being and like drops of pure water entering a vessel of impure water, drop by<br>
drop the non-essentials are forced out and the essentials remain.<br>
These powerful words, acting upon you (your being) in the same way that<br>
food does upon your body, automatically find their own needed places and uses<br>
within, in the same manner as do the elements in the food which you eat, and you<br>
should not look for results from this practice any more than you look for results<br>
from what you eat daily. You are to practice this system every evening as<br>
regularly and diligently as your affairs will permit and then forget them entirely<br>
until the next evening. They will be doing their work below the surface unknown<br>
to you, but their effects will show forth in you and your affairs.<br>
You Are Very Fortunate in Having Learned<br>
This Wisdom. Now, by All Means<br>
Practice It! <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>

Approaching the close of your instructions, I believe it well to outline an<br>
example of procedure for you. Since, as I have previously said, words are often so<br>
inadequate to convey the proper meaning when dealing with a subject of this kind,<br>
I will approach facts from different angles for better elucidation.<br>
Here is an example: Invoking the aid of this law, neither money, friends or<br>
influence are necessary to the attainment of whatever your heart is set upon.<br>
Whether you are a banker, a clerk or a bootblack. It is no respecter of person<br>
or position. Whether your ambition lies in direct line with the position you are<br>
now occupying, or whether it necessitates an entire change from what you are<br>
doing. You may have no definite plan in life except the fact that you want to get<br>
ahead. Since all the desire in the world will get you nowhere, it becomes necessary<br>
that a definite objective be first arrived at and then firmly established within.<br>
After intelligent deliberation you decide upon one Supreme Goal. It is<br>
distant, perhaps, but the glorious assurance is that it can be attained. What is your<br>
first step? If a banker or merchant, is it a definite increase in volume monthly? Or,<br>
if an employee, is it a position above? There, you have your first and nearest<br>
objective in the direction of your Supreme Objective.<br>
When the first objective is reached, what then? Set another one beyond that,<br>
immediately. Why? Because the peculiar nature of the Outer mind is to drop back<br>
into inertia after being forced through to an objective. You can imagine the Outer<br>
mind reflecting something after this fashion: &quot;Well, I have been mercilessly<br>
whipped about and forced through to that thing, but I reached it and now I will<br>
have a rest.&quot; And your answer will be: &quot;No rest for you, for I have already started<br>
you upon another.&quot; Because, once having attained that valuable momentum,<br>
maintain it. Cling to it. And as the momentum increases, the steps in your<br>
progress become more rapid, until eventually it will be possible to reach an<br>
objective almost immediately, as is the practice of those in my work. <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 43 -<br>
The course followed in bringing forth your objective can be likened exactly<br>
to the process that takes place in a seed. Being fixed in the darkness of the soil, it<br>
proceeds to express or out-picture the exact picture held within its life cell and, in<br>
obedience to law, it sends up a shoot seeking the light. At the same time, it sends<br>
down roots seeking nourishment. If, on the way up, that shoot encounters<br>
obstacles in any form, it does not attempt to force them out of its way. It travels<br>
around them. If the roots fail to find the required nourishment, it withers away. If<br>
all goes well, it blossoms forth and, having reached its goal, a seed is again<br>
dropped and the process repeated. Bear in mind that the actual process takes place<br>
in darkness, beneath the surface. Thus it is with us. That is where all great and<br>
important ideas are developed.<br>
Now, are you going to cast glances out of the corner of your eye to see how<br>
the thing is proceeding? Are you going to set to wondering how the thing works,<br>
or if it really is working? Not at all. You set the objective. You therefore planted<br>
the seed. You would not dig up a seed in your garden to see if it were sprouting.<br>
You planted and watered it and are satisfied that, according to the law of its being,<br>
it will come forth. Likewise, nothing upon earth can prevent your objective from<br>
becoming externalized, because nothing in the world can nullify Universal Law.<br>
You plant the seed idea. You hold it there. You nourish it. You have done your<br>
part. Trust the Law to do its part.<br>
Will you encounter resistance? Oh, yes. Your activity creates it. Why?<br>
Because action requires reaction to support it. Resistance is the negative pole of<br>
action or activity, the positive pole as you have already heard, and you need both.<br>
If there were no resistance, action would be non-existent.<br>
It is resistance that keeps the airplane soaring. Without resistance, it could<br>
not fly. Neither could the birds; or the fish swim; or you walk. As the power of<br>
the engine increases, the greater the momentum of the airplane and the greater the<br>
resistance necessary to support it. The greater the momentum, the greater the <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 44 -<br>
altitude or height possible to attain. With the decrease in engine power comes the<br>
decrease in momentum and the consequent dropping of the plane.<br>
This is an example for us. Momentum must be attained and then maintained<br>
if we are to reach the heights of achievement. And the work is delightful after the<br>
apparent difficulty of the first steps are passed. For there is nothing more joyous<br>
than the satisfaction of having achieved something worthwhile.<br>
Are you to recognize resistance in any guise? No. For, if you recognize it as<br>
a power opposed to your progress, you are resisting it, therefore you automatically<br>
acknowledge it as a power greater than you, for no lesser power can retard the<br>
progress of a greater one. That is plain. And going further, remember this great<br>
truth: Whoever or whatever you resist, be it in thought, word or action; be it in the<br>
form of criticism, envy, jealousy, hatred or otherwise, you most assuredly help, and<br>
you weaken yourself proportionately. Why? Because you have deliberately taken<br>
a portion of your precious life force so necessary to your progress, and transferred<br>
it to that person or thing. Have you not witnessed the case at times, of one<br>
becoming exhausted after a &quot;fit of rage&quot; over another? Exhaustion is depletion.<br>
And to deplete means to empty. Something went out. Yes, to the other person to<br>
his profit and the other's loss. This is an example of the transfer of life force in a<br>
violent form. You are very fortunate in having learned this wisdom. Now, by all<br>
means, practice it.<br>
Stand as Master of Your Own Being and<br>
Hold Your Course Steadfast to the Goal<br>
What then should be your daily attitude? What is the attitude of the wind as<br>
it speeds on its way to its destination? It yields recognition to neither person, place<br>
or thing as having any power to hinder it. The harm or the help it gives is <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 45 -<br>
measured only by the welfare of the particular one it affects. It is aware of causing<br>
neither harmful nor helpful results, for it is impersonal. The sun shines, the rain<br>
falls and the wind blows upon all alike. They choose no particular persons or<br>
things to help or harm.<br>
There is your lesson. You are not to be consciously aware of resisting or<br>
harming anyone in your way as you speed along to your goal. Those who attempt<br>
to hinder you are helping you and should be considered your friends. This is<br>
wisdom of the highest order.<br>
Keeping the secret of your aspirations locked securely within you sets up<br>
antagonism in the Outer mind, for due to its nature, it rebels against discipline and<br>
subjugation. That evident weakness which stifled your great ambitions in the past<br>
is an illustration of the nature of this Outer mind. That is its habitual trait.<br>
Seeing that it is about to be deprived of its wanton freedom, it will, like a<br>
wild bull in a stockade, seek to escape by every means except the way that you<br>
have provided. I am warning you. It will bring up every sort of argument to bear<br>
upon the futility of your purpose. It will tempt you to mention your plans and<br>
ambitions to others; to slow up in your activity; to doubt the power of the law<br>
operating in your behalf. It will try every known conceivable way to thwart you.<br>
And your answer to all this will be, &quot;Obey. I am master here.&quot; Stand as master of<br>
your own being and hold your course steadfast to the goal.<br>
You may be led through strange places and take circuitous routes at times,<br>
but let that not disturb you. With the wisdom of the Inner mind at the helm, you<br>
are being led the quickest way, although it might appear to be the longest.<br>
This advice is necessary for you now as a beginner, but as you grow in<br>
practice you will find that these qualities become a part of your very being. They<br>
then function automatically, entirely without any conscious effort on your part.<br>
What is the result? Due to the persistent holding to the goal and your<br>
absolutely air-tight secretiveness, the Outer mind finds no escape for its increasing <br>
The Magic Story - Part II - by John McDonald<br>
- 46 -<br>
energy and in desperation it plunges through, like the overload of steam through<br>
the safety valve of a boiler and your objective is reached.<br>
We have come to the close of your instructions. Go forth and practice what<br>
you know. Living the law will make you a character of notice. People will be<br>
instinctively attracted to you both upon the street and among your social and<br>
business associates, without knowing why. You will become a mysterious being to<br>
the world. Let this not turn your head, but rather, in humble gratitude, give thanks<br>
to the great Supreme Power that has made this possible.<br>
from PSALM 8<br>
1. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy<br>
glory above the heavens.<br>
3. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars,<br>
which thou hast ordained;<br>
4. What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou<br>
visitest him?<br>
5. For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him<br>
with glory and honour.<br>
6. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put<br>
all things under his feet!
