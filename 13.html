  The following pages are the result of a series of notes collected and set down in the form of a<br>
  story and a system of practice, which accounts for the style of arrangement. The sequential<br>
  order as originally received has been carefully adhered to so that its value to the reader might<br>
  not be lessened.<br>
  It sets forth no creed or dogma, but teaches in a clear, understandable, simple way, step by<br>
  step, a practical, workable procedure based upon Divine Law, for the mastery of environment<br>
  and conditions.<br>
  Surely, there is an unexplainable “something” within its pages which carries a wonderful power<br>
  for helpfulness and which saturates the reader with a dynamic realization and conviction of<br>
  what it teaches.<br>
  This is not a volume to be hurriedly or superficially read. It must be studied in order to gain the<br>
  priceless wisdom which it contains. Therefore it is strongly urged that, after having been read<br>
  through once or twice, it be given the slow, deep, deliberate study which has proved to be the<br>
  profitable way with a work of this kind.<br>
  Read it as though it were a message directed to none but yourself. Try to reason out each<br>
  proposition to your own satisfaction and to get the spirit back of the words. Then apply its<br>
  teachings to fit your own individual nature and understanding.<br>
  During your perusal of these pages should any ideas occur to you concerning your work or<br>
  ambitions, it is well to lay the book aside for a few moments and meditate upon them. Many<br>
  profitable ideas have come to readers in this way.<br>

  PART I</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p> Presuming that there are many who are just as skeptical concerning things bordering on the<br>
  extraordinary as I have been practically all of my life, I offer the following story and system of<br>
  practice to each reader for what it is worth, with the suggestion that he take it or leave it, just<br>
  as he sees fit.<br>
  It was Saturday afternoon and I had returned from a late lunch. The help had left for the day<br>
  and I was alone. My business had dropped off considerably of late and while conditions were<br>
  not alarming, yet they were sufficient to cause me some concern. Then again, I had recently<br>
  indulged in some real estate speculation which had not proved successful. Taking it all in all, it<br>
  was not a very cheerful outlook. In fact the most serious problem of my business career was up<br>
  for solution.<br>
  Sitting there in deep thought in an effort to discover a way out, I was aroused by the telephone<br>
  bell. Placing the receiver to my ear I was startled at hearing the familiar voice of my old friend,<br>
  David B____. It required no great stretch of the imagination to believe it a voice from the dead,<br>
  for less than a month before he had left for Europe on the urgent advice of his physician to take<br>
  an ocean voyage, preferably, but get away somewhere, in the hope that a change would effect<br>
  an improvement in his condition, which was a serious breakdown, due to worry over conditions<br>
  which, strangely, were similar to what I was now experiencing.<br>
  As he spoke, his voice carried such striking power and feeling that I was reminded of my last<br>
  impression of Dave as we sorrowfully parted with him, a miserable shadow of his former self,<br>
  and we questioned as to whether we would ever see him again.<br>
  But here he was back again, and surely some great change had taken place in him. Remarking<br>
  that a miracle must have happened, he assured me that I had guessed about right, adding,<br>
  “Tom, I know that you are puzzled over my early return and I also know that you never<br>
  expected to see me again. But I’m back and I’m the luckiest man in the world, for I learned<br>
  something that I never knew existed. Tom, nothing is impossible with me anymore, for I can do<br>
  anything. I am master of my own destiny and I can make my life anything that I wish it to be.<br>
  “Oh, don’t think I’m crazy. Wait until you hear my story.” Feigning a laugh to cover my serious<br>
  curiosity, I remarked that he must have stumbled over some newfangled religion. To which he<br>
  replied, “On the contrary, it concerns no religion of any kind or of anybody. You see, I met a<br>
  Master. A wonderful man who has so developed his powers that he can do anything, and he<br>
  taught me a secret that no price could ever buy. You know that I lost my health and I lost my<br>
  wealth. Well, I have regained my health and I will have the wealth in no time. Oh, it’s a strange<br>
  story.” Of course I became excited to see him at once and when to his inquiry about the club I<br>
  replied that there were no changes, he hung up after saying, “Meet me there at 9:00 tonight<br>
  and I will unfold a series of the most remarkable and fortunate happenings that could fall to the<br>
  lot of any man.”<br>
  I sat there unmoved for some minutes like a man in a dream, so completely absorbed had I<br>
  become in the remarkable recital. Upon recovering myself I became possessed of the feeling<br>
  that I had suddenly grown too big for the office. That I had outgrown that little place. I must get<br>
  outside and expand in the fresh air. Feverish with excitement, I put on my hat and stepped out. <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 4<br>
  Feeling that there was something wonderful for me in his story, I was seized with an<br>
  uncontrollable desire to hear it at once. I turned in the direction of his office, but recalling that<br>
  he was no longer there, was forced to wait until evening. The remainder of that day was spent<br>
  in restlessly pacing the streets and I was greatly relieved when the hour to go to the club<br>
  arrived.<br>
  Having resolved to get Dave away where we would not be disturbed, I entered and stepped<br>
  quickly to the desk, only to be in-formed that he had telephoned some time before to tell me<br>
  that he had been called away and would be back the following evening. Trying to conceal my<br>
  disappointment and feelings, I turned quickly and was greeted by three friends who had seen<br>
  him, and each was excitedly trying to tell me of the wonders that had taken place. Miserable<br>
  and disconsolate, I broke away from them without uttering a word, walked out into the night<br>
  and home.<br>
  Too agitated for sleep, the greater part of the night was passed in restless confusion. Assailed<br>
  by the most illogical thoughts, I decided that the whole thing was a myth, conjured up in a mind<br>
  weakened as the result of affliction. How utterly ridiculous to allow myself to become upset by<br>
  such a fairy tale. But no, somehow the thing would not down, but kept forcing itself upon me,<br>
  until in desperation I tried to console myself with the assurance that I would at any cost learn<br>
  the truth or falsity of the whole matter the next day.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p> Following instructions which I had left at the club to be delivered to him immediately upon his<br>
  return, Dave picked me up at my home in a new, high-priced car, and we drove out to a<br>
  highway cafe. There, in a private dining-room, undisturbed by the presence of others, I had<br>
  opportunity to study my old friend.<br>
  Surely some miraculous change had taken place in him. His countenance glowed with health<br>
  and vitality and his calm, poised bearing inspired wonderful admiration and confidence. But<br>
  while I felt perfectly at ease in his company, I also felt the force of some presence in him that I<br>
  could neither understand or describe. Whatever it was, it had the effect of putting one at ease<br>
  and yet had the tendency to command respect for something one did not understand. While I<br>
  felt greatly relieved after the excitement of the previous day, yet I found difficulty in concealing<br>
  the emotions that surged up within me, for I felt satisfied and convinced that he had something<br>
  that I sorely needed and I had the strangest fear lest something might occur even then to<br>
  prevent my getting it.<br>
  He broke a momentary silence that seemed hours to me by asking, “Tom, do I look any<br>
  different than the day I left’!” I had to admit that he was both a revelation and a mystery to me.<br>
  He continued, “It was in a theatre in London that I met the man, or the Master, as he is called,<br>
  that I am deeply grateful for the privilege of calling my friend. Tom, you didn’t know that I left<br>
  here determined to end it all. I had made such a mess of my affairs. But I feared to live and I<br>
  feared to die. I couldn’t rest. To keep moving was my only relief. I guess I was what the world<br>
  would call a hopeless case.<br>
  “As I look back upon that evening in London, how well I now realize that my utter despondency<br>
  and the intense longing to find something to relieve me drew me and my dear friend together. I<br>
  had decided upon a regular orchestra seat, but discovered that for some unexplainable reason I <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 5<br>
  had ordered a box and found myself seated beside my friend. Extraordinary happenings, such<br>
  as this, occur frequently too many of us and are explained away, because of our ignorance, as<br>
  merely coincidences. But I know differently now.<br>
  “I could feel that my uneasiness attracted his attention. The wonderful radiance of his<br>
  countenance assured me that he was an unusual personage and I felt an instinctive urge to<br>
  open my heart to him. The remark, ‘I am sorely troubled,’ uttered by a character upon the stage<br>
  started our acquaintance. I replied ‘so am I,’ in just a whisper, but my friend heard it and<br>
  turning to me he asked, ‘are you troubled?’ I nodded my head in response and you may believe<br>
  me or not, but almost immediately I was at ease. Something seemed to tell me that I had the<br>
  good fortune of being in the presence of one of those great spiritual people of whom I had read<br>
  quite a bit in earlier years.<br>
  “I felt convinced that I had met my deliverer, and at the close of the performance was<br>
  overjoyed at his invitation to accompany him to a nearby cafe. I noticed that the attention of<br>
  those in the cafe was drawn toward him as we entered and that the management was<br>
  noticeably respectful and courteous toward him. Having convinced myself that this man<br>
  possessed some sort of magical power, I determined to ask him all the questions that I could<br>
  think of and with his permission make notes of his answers.<br>
  “Learning that he was taking steamer for New York the next day, I asked if I might accompany<br>
  him, to which he assented. At the conclusion of our talk I observed that he merely wrote his<br>
  initials on the bill and as we stepped outside to call a cab I questioned him regarding this and he<br>
  admitted that he was not known there, as this was his first visit to the place, but he assured me<br>
  that they would be paid, adding, ‘I did this to show you that man in his right domain controls<br>
  every situation.’ I was still puzzled, but carried the subject no further, hoping that it would all<br>
  be made plain to me later.<br>
  “That night, as I lay in a doze, the events of the evening kept passing through my mind and at<br>
  times I found difficulty in realizing that my good fortune was real, rather than the illusion of a<br>
  dream. That night I had the first peaceful sleep in months.”</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p> “The following morning, up early and supremely happy and eager for what the day would<br>
  unfold, I immediately applied for a reservation on the steamer, only to be informed that they<br>
  had a full passenger list, but as I turned away, almost heartbroken at such an unfortunate turn<br>
  of events, I was recalled by the clerk with the information that a reservation had just been<br>
  cancelled and that I might have it. Instantly I felt forcibly struck with the thought that here was<br>
  more of my friend’s ‘magic,’ as I then called it, and I was not mistaken, for he later admitted<br>
  that he had made a place for me. Of course, you do not understand how the thing works, Tom.<br>
  Neither did I, at the time, but I do now, and it is oh, so simple. I believe its simplicity causes it to<br>
  be overlooked.<br>
  “Presently my friend arrived, with his servant, and, as usual, being surrounded by attendants<br>
  eager to be of service and assistance. I clung to him persistently throughout the entire voyage,<br>
  and he appeared to enjoy my company.<br>
  “The first evening out, I visited him in his luxuriously-furnished stateroom, for he has the best<br>
  of everything wherever he goes, and while explaining the wonderful forces that man in his <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 6<br>
  ignorance has permitted to lie dormant within him, he gave me several demonstrations of the<br>
  powers that he has developed. He did things that were actually astounding. He asked, ‘Why<br>
  cannot you do what I do? Why cannot all do as I do? I have no powers that you are not<br>
  endowed with. Here is my answer: Because of my knowledge of Universal Law, I have<br>
  developed the God-given powers within me, while you, in your ignorance, have been<br>
  dissipating and scattering yours. All men use the same power, for in all the universe there is but<br>
  one power. This is self-evident, as you shall see.’<br>
  “Continuing, he said: ‘the great masses of humanity are using the Law destructively, or partially<br>
  so, and the scales are balanced against them. Here and there, among the masses, we find an<br>
  occasional outstanding figure who has achieved greatness or success and he is erroneously<br>
  singled out as lucky or as a genius, when the fact is that be has made use of the Law---whether<br>
  knowingly or unknowingly, it matters not --- at least sufficiently to have the scales balanced in<br>
  his favor. How plain this is to the one who knows.’<br>
  “Before the discovery of the law governing the use of electricity this great force was lying<br>
  dormant throughout the universe, at least as far as man’s knowledge was concerned. He had<br>
  first to discover the law before he could turn it to his advantage. Just so with this Universal Law.<br>
  ‘‘‘Happiness is man’s rightful heritage. It is the summum bonus of his aspirations. The very<br>
  soul of man cries out for happiness, but he misinterprets it in terms of money. Why? Because<br>
  money is a means to an end. It is the motive power which drives us on in our quest for the<br>
  ultimate, which is happiness. In the world there cannot be happiness without money. Therefore<br>
  the occupation of acquiring money is a worthy and commendable one.<br>
  “Why should man, the supreme creation of the universe, suffer all sorts of lack, misery and<br>
  unhappiness when such inferior creatures as the beasts of the field, the birds of the air and the<br>
  fish of the sea are bountifully supplied? For any man, no matter what his station in life, to take<br>
  the stand that it is the destiny of man to want for anything that will contribute to his happiness<br>
  or that of his family is ridiculous.<br>
  “Somebody discovers the law governing the use of etheric waves and we have radio. Millions<br>
  of people are now enjoying its advantages. They tune in to what they want and they get it.<br>
  There is a great lesson in this, for believe me, you may have anything you want and in<br>
  abundance, when you learn to tune in with an infinitely greater power than electricity or its<br>
  vehicle, radio. With a power that you have had from the beginning.<br>
  “The captain of this ship could just as easily own it as run it. One position is no more difficult of<br>
  attainment than the other. He tuned in to the captaincy successfully. Ownership was a little<br>
  more distant and he did not try for distance. That is all. The actual difference in the two<br>
  positions is merely the difference in two words. Nothing more, as you shall see very plainly<br>
  when we get a little further along.’<br>
  “Each night, after retiring to my room, I would sit up until early morning reading my notes of<br>
  the day and preparing questions for the next. He told me that I was very ‘receptive’ because of<br>
  my eagerness, sincerity and trust, and that it was a pleasure to instruct me. And in gratitude I<br>
  acknowledged that no price was too high or sacrifice too great in return for such knowledge.<br>
  “In answer to my question as to when and how he discovered such a secret, he said, ‘I<br>
  discovered nothing and to me it is no secret. This knowledge has been in our family as far back<br>
  as our records go. I use it because I know it to be the easy, certain way of accomplishing a<br>
  purpose, while you have known only the difficult, uncertain way.’ He seemed never to want to <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 7<br>
  take credit for anything, always claiming that no credit was due him.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p> “I was rapidly regaining my health and strength and was becoming fired with an irresistible<br>
  ambition to get back and start all over again. Censuring myself for having wasted so many<br>
  valuable years in fruitless effort in my old way, I was eager to start in the new way. Approaching<br>
  the end of our voyage and feeling that I was soon to part from my great benefactor, to whom I<br>
  had become greatly attached and to whom I owed so much, I handed him my card and asked<br>
  for his, to which he replied, ‘I have no card, no name, no address. I am like the wind. I come<br>
  from nowhere and I go everywhere. As for my name, you may call me Friend.’ Saying that I<br>
  would much prefer to call him Master, he replied, ‘No, no, not Master. Just Friend. That will do.’<br>
  Glancing at my card, he said, ‘I turn up at most unexpected places. I might be out to see you<br>
  soon. If I do, I will write you.’<br>
  “I shall never forget the parting instructions that he gave me. In a manner like a parent with a<br>
  child, he said, ‘You are indeed a fortunate man. Just think of the millions of gifted, highly<br>
  talented people, many blessed with rare qualities for success and leadership whose<br>
  achievements would mean so much to their fellow men and happiness and contentment to<br>
  themselves and their families who do not know what you know. But who go on striving and<br>
  straining, wasting their precious life force, only to find themselves dissatisfied, discouraged,<br>
  disheartened, crushed, as you once were, yet spurred on by that divine spark, that irresistible<br>
  urge within by which they instinctively realize that there is a way but which they, in their<br>
  ignorance, misinterpret and consequently find themselves failures after years of despairing<br>
  effort.<br>
  “All this you can now avoid. Go home. You have learned all that you will need. If you will<br>
  diligently follow the instructions that I have given, you may reach any heights. You may<br>
  accomplish any worthy purpose easily and quickly. There need be no limit to your possibilities.<br>
  Your successes will multiply and increase in pro-portion to your mastery of the Law. With each<br>
  success your faith in the Law grows stronger until you reach the point of conviction. Then you<br>
  are invincible.<br>
  “Bear in mind the warning that I have repeatedly given you. Reveal nothing of this to even your<br>
  dearest friend. To do so before you are powerfully fortified in the Law would only tend to<br>
  interfere with your plans, but particularly, it would result in the scattering of your forces and<br>
  consequently weaken their power for your good. Therefore, keep your secret securely locked<br>
  within your heart. You will never be able to work out another’s problems. Neither will another<br>
  be able to work out yours. This is strictly a matter for each individual. Accomplishment of<br>
  anything, in any line, is the result of the operation of this inner force, discovered and set to<br>
  work, and this must be done by each one for himself. There is no other way.<br>
  “When the time arrives that you shall have retired from commercial pursuits, you may, after<br>
  seeking the guidance of your conscience, release it for the benefit of others. Thus liberated<br>
  from further commercial allurements, you will be free to devote your life to the uplift of your<br>
  fellow man, lending your help to freeing him from the bondage of want, misery and<br>
  unhappiness.’ <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 8<br>
  “Reluctantly parting with my benefactor as he entered a taxi with his servant and gave<br>
  directions to his hotel, I started down the street unconscious of the crowds and with such a<br>
  peculiar sensation of exaltation and buoyancy that I seemed to be just floating along rather<br>
  than walking. Sleep had no attraction for me and it was with difficulty that I induced myself to<br>
  retire to a hotel.<br>
  “On the train speeding home I carefully avoided all unnecessary contact with my fellow<br>
  passengers. I kept to my state-room. Oh, how I wanted to be alone and to think. I could not<br>
  think of sparing any of my precious time for worthless, idle conversation and gossip. How<br>
  useless it seemed to me now, when there was so much to be accomplished. I was just<br>
  dominated by the one compelling purpose to try out my new teaching and not another day<br>
  could be wasted. Nothing else interested me and nothing else mattered.<br>
  “There you have as much of my story as I am at liberty to reveal at this time, and I give you this<br>
  much in the hope that it will encourage you to such an extent that you will consider any<br>
  personal sacrifice well worth the price of such knowledge. For years I have been blindly seeking<br>
  what I never imagined existed, and now that I have it, no fortune is large enough to buy it.”<br>
  Noticing upon me the appalling effect of his inability to enlighten me further, Dave attempted<br>
  to ease my feelings with the assurance that he would see that I got in touch with the Master<br>
  upon his arrival. This only intensified my determination as I excitedly exclaimed, “I’ll never wait<br>
  for an arrival that might never occur. By the gods I’ll find him if you will give me the name of his<br>
  hotel.” So different from his former excitable nature, he remained calm and poised as he<br>
  replied that he had not overheard the name.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p> There was nothing for me to do now but settle down as best I could to impatiently waiting and<br>
  hoping while he immediately plunged into his former occupation, that of operating in the<br>
  market. Because of his secretiveness we knew little of his affairs, although we met him a few<br>
  times at the club. On such occasions, none of us seemed to have the courage to question him<br>
  regarding himself and he talked on every subject but that. However, it was but a short time<br>
  until his activities reached such proportions that he was compelled to carry on his operations to<br>
  some extent through a few of his close friends, including myself. It was then that I learned in<br>
  part the magnitude of them.<br>
  Fearing that such successes could not last, I attempted to advise greater caution, warning him<br>
  that someday his bubble would burst and then where would he be. With a quick turn toward<br>
  me, and with his characteristic dominant expression, he replied, “Tom, you need have no<br>
  concern about my welfare. I operate according to definite unerring law. If you want to get the<br>
  square feet contained in this room, you would get the two dimensions, and following a process<br>
  laid down by the law of mathematics, you would arrive at a definite result. You would be<br>
  certain of the success of the process from the beginning. Just so with my work. I know the<br>
  outcome before I start.” That was the last mention I ever made to him of his affairs and he<br>
  never referred to them.<br>
  There seemed to be no stopping to him, for he went on from one success to another. His<br>
  perpetual energy and vitality seemed to never lag and the dynamic force with which he seemed<br>
  to dominate every situation and overwhelm all opposition to his progress was actually <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 9<br>
  superhuman. At the few social gatherings which he attended, his magnetic personality and the<br>
  mystery with which his name was associated made him the center of attention.<br>
  Because of his desire to avoid notice, I saw little of him for some time and hearing no news of<br>
  the Master, I had just about be-come resigned to my fate when one day his secretary<br>
  telephoned that there was a letter at his office which would interest me. Hurrying over, I was<br>
  handed a letter, written on the stationery of a prominent hotel and addressed to him, which<br>
  read: “Detained by important affairs. Regret to have to forego a visit with you this time.” And<br>
  signed, “Your Friend.”<br>
  At last my chance had come. The hotel was my only clue, but it was enough. Hastily getting my<br>
  three interested associates together, we left, and that evening found us speeding eastward in<br>
  our quest of the Master and the “secret.” Entering the hotel, upon our arrival, I went direct to<br>
  the manager and informed him of our mission. He knew immediately and told me that because<br>
  of the many visitors who were crowding the Master he had departed, leaving no address. He<br>
  had no further information to give us.<br>
  Again I was thoroughly disheartened. Was I ever to learn that “secret?” I really believed that I<br>
  was not. However, we got a good description of him and decided to continue our search. We<br>
  separated in order to work more effectively, but our search was without success until the night<br>
  of the fifth day. I sat alone in the lobby of our hotel that night after my associates had retired,<br>
  following an hour of argument in an effort to persuade me to return home. I decided that I<br>
  would not give up. I would continue the search for-ever, if necessary.<br>
  Sitting there in a deserted corner at that hour in the early morning my feelings suddenly<br>
  changed from utter despondency to joyous elation. Somehow, I knew that my search was at an<br>
  end and while pondering over this I became possessed of a sense of some presence behind<br>
  me. Immediately — a hand touched my shoulder. I arose, turned, and there before me, I looked<br>
  into the most magnificent face that I have ever seen. And the eyes! They sparkled like jewels.<br>
  And a voice said, “Are you looking for me?” I merely answered, “I am,” for I knew it was he.<br>
  I will not go into his explanation of the causes which led up to our meeting, but after a long<br>
  talk, during which he explained that his time was so busily occupied that there was no way in<br>
  which he could give any instructions; that he was not even receiving visitors during this short<br>
  visit to this country, but that he would advise me of his next visit, I vehemently exclaimed with<br>
  all the intensity of my being that I was desperately in need of him; that we had come thousands<br>
  of miles to learn his wisdom and that I was willing to sacrifice anything for just a little of his<br>
  knowledge. My desperation and the intensity of my appeal must have aroused his compassion,<br>
  for he agreed to receive us for instructions the following morning at his apartment.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p> The sight that met our eyes as we entered his apartment that morning will stand out vividly in<br>
  my memory. Never before or since have I seen such luxuriance and extravagance displayed as<br>
  in the furnishings of that place. It seemed like desecration to tread upon those magnificent silk<br>
  rugs as we were led by his servant through a room delicately perfumed by an abundance of<br>
  flowers artistically arranged, to a room which appeared to be his study and where chairs had<br>
  already been placed for us.<br>
  His entry immediately after was followed by a round of introductions, names, occupations and <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 10<br>
  general remarks. We had expected to see him attired in some gorgeous style in keeping with his<br>
  surroundings, but were struck by the simplicity in both his dress and his bearing. My impression<br>
  was that being conscious of his power, he preferred to shun publicity and people rather than be<br>
  the object of any attention and he explained the presence of the furnishings by saying that he<br>
  loved beautiful things and therefore surrounded himself with them.<br>
  He began our instructions by saying, “You may have come here in expectation of seeing a<br>
  mysterious being endowed with mystic powers. A sort of magician who can pull a fortune out of<br>
  the air and pass it over to you. You have very much misled yourselves. I am just an ordinary<br>
  man, no different than you are. The world calls such as me, a Master. And so I am, but only in<br>
  the sense that I have learned how to master environment and conditions. That I have<br>
  developed in me the powers that abide alike in all of us and that I am more nearly living life as it<br>
  should be lived.<br>
  “I realize that you have come here because of your faith in me and that you look upon me<br>
  somewhat as an exalted personality. But in order that you may gain the greatest benefit from<br>
  these teachings I will ask that you wipe out any impression that you may have of me as a<br>
  personality. I assure you that I am worthy of no honor or homage. I am just a human like you. I<br>
  am not a superior being. Rather am I a humble being, thankful for the knowledge that I have<br>
  gained. I made no discoveries. I received these instructions in much the same manner that I am<br>
  about to give them to you.<br>
  “You will find no difficulty in putting these principles into practice in your everyday affairs. They<br>
  are as available to you as to me, for this great Law is no respecter of persons. It is the highest<br>
  and most effective possible in worldly affairs and is well worth learning, for its practice results<br>
  in a life that is well worth living.<br>
  “Employing these principles wisely and intelligently, there can be no uncertainty as to the<br>
  outcome of any undertaking and no limit to your possibilities. As you go on and on, your<br>
  confidence increases and you find that your powers are increasing. You accomplish greater<br>
  things with greater ease and greater speed. As its growth in you increases, your<br>
  accomplishments increase likewise.<br>
  “With many, remarkable improvement comes quickly as in the case of your friend who is<br>
  responsible for you being here today. With others, the growth is more gradual. The difference is<br>
  not any difference in the individual, for all are endowed with the same capacity, but it is a<br>
  difference in the degree of intensity employed. However, no man could ever receive these<br>
  instructions and not become a better man because of them.<br>
  “No great things are accomplished in the consciousness of personality. That is impossible, for<br>
  personality is limiting. Therefore, accept these lessons for just what they mean to you alone as<br>

  PART II</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p> In imparting the principles of this law to you, I will ask that you overlook any apparent<br>
  contradictions, for, of necessity, they are bound to occur when treating upon a subject of this<br>
  kind in order that propositions otherwise obscure may be made clear. And again, you must<br>
  understand that I am using your language to convey my meaning and I meet with some<br>
  difficulty in doing so. I want you to bear in mind this advice:<br>
  Take these teachings for just what they mean to you individually. If some statements do not<br>
  appeal to you at this time, make no effort to force yourself to accept them. What you might<br>
  reject or fail to understand now will no doubt appear plain and become valuable to you later, as<br>
  your capacity to receive increases.<br>
  There are times when the changing of words makes a subject more clear or appealing to<br>
  people of different mentalities. Therefore, if you find that the replacing of my words for your<br>
  own at times makes any statement clearer or seems to fit in with your particular mental makeup<br>
  or belief, you may do so, freely.<br>
  He who is wise in his own conceit, who approaches a subject in an attitude of doubt and<br>
  resistance, will learn little. There is not much hope for him. But he who takes up any subject in<br>
  an open mind, willing to learn anything that will contribute to his advancement, comfort and<br>
  happiness, is wise.<br>
  Therefore, while I do not ask that you believe all that I tell you, for to do so would be to intrude<br>
  upon your God-given freedom of thought, yet neither do I wish you to doubt or resist what I tell<br>
  you, for that would prevent you from gaining the help you are seeking. For your own highest<br>
  and greatest good, your attitude should be just this: I am going to take these teachings in an<br>
  open-minded, neutral attitude, determined that I shall gain all the benefit there is in them for<br>
  me. The fact that I do not understand or even believe any particular statement or proposition at<br>
  this time, does not necessarily make it any the less true.<br>
  To be able to make use of the Law as outlined, it is necessary that you have a clear<br>
  understanding of its operation. To this end, I will illustrate, wherever possible, the different<br>
  propositions with examples in nature that you will find all about you and that will help you in<br>
  reasoning out these truths to a logical conclusion.<br>
  Your mind, which is yourself, can be likened to a house which the accumulation of years has<br>
  cluttered with thousands of un-necessary pieces of furniture, pictures, ornaments and other<br>
  things, all strewn around and heaped everywhere, with the result that while the outside of that<br>
  house might present a good appearance, the inside is a mass of confusion and disorder. How<br>
  utterly impossible to accomplish anything under such conditions, for you cannot go after one<br>
  thing without stumbling over another. No order. No purpose. No progress. The first necessary<br>
  move, then, is to rid that house of all but the furnishings essential to success.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II<br>
  How did you get here? You grew from a minute cell smaller than the point of a pin. Just think!<br>
  A cell or seed the size of a pin point contained within itself in essence and in entirety, the<br>
  wonderful being that you are today. <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 12<br>
  Surely, that cell could not possibly contain the material forms, no matter how infinitesimal they<br>
  might be, of body, head, hair, arms, legs, hands, feet and all the wonderful organs of the body.<br>
  Well, then, how did you arrive at your full stature as you now appear? There is but one logical<br>
  answer—that cell contained a spark of Mind, the one and only power supreme in man. That<br>
  spark of mind, true to the law of its own being, held a fixed image or picture of you and you<br>
  unfolded, grew and eventually out-pictured or became objectified in obedience to that law.<br>
  Surely, you cannot reasonably deny that, in the process of nature, you originated in a cell. And<br>
  you will not deny that you could not be contained bodily in that cell. Therefore, the only<br>
  conclusion is, that you must have been in that cell mentally.<br>
  Should your understanding fail to immediately grasp this truth, your reasoning faculty will<br>
  readily admit that there is a power at work in that cell unfolding according to a definite plan. So<br>
  intelligence must be present. Admitting the presence of intelligence, it follows that we must<br>
  admit of the presence of Mind.<br>
  It is necessary at this point to get one fact clearly before you, for it is the fundamental basis<br>
  from which we proceed, and that clearly is this: that Mind, no matter what form it is apparently<br>
  contained in, holds images, pictures. And any picture firmly held in any mind, in any form,<br>
  is bound to come forth.<br>
  This is the great, unchanging Universal Law which, when we cooperate with it intelligently,<br>
  makes us absolute masters of conditions and environment.<br>
  Can you not recall instances when you have secretly expressed a desire within yourself for<br>
  some particular thing or that you might meet a particular person, when, shortly, that thing<br>
  becomes your possession or that person appears, and you might exclaim: “Isn’t it a<br>
  coincidence? I was thinking of you just this morning?” It is no coincidence at all. Not at all<br>
  strange. It was the natural outcome of the operation of definite law.<br>
  If this be true, why do not all wishes or thoughts appear? Many do, but because of the absence<br>
  of alertness, due to ignorance of the law, they pass unnoticed. And again, many do not manifest<br>
  at all. To illustrate this, I can use your knowledge of radio. You attempt to tune in to one station<br>
  for some delightful music, but because of there being a number of others on the air; your<br>
  reward is a jumble of confusion. But should you reach that station when others are temporarily<br>
  off, you get it clearly and your desire is gratified.<br>
  The answer to the question is this: It happened that, by chance, those thoughts or desires<br>
  which appeared arose at just the instant when there were no other conflicting thoughts present<br>
  to nullify their power, and the mind, instead of being divided among many thoughts, threw its<br>
  great force in with the one and it became out-pictured or externalized.<br>
  You have experienced times when your mind became a complete blank for just a moment and<br>
  you found yourself staring out into space. If at that instant it were possible to inject any wish,<br>
  any desire, with sufficient force, nothing upon earth could prevent it from coming forth<br>
  instantly.<br>
  Now, what is the cause of the confusion prevailing in mind which weakens your thought? It is<br>
  the false belief that there is a power or powers outside of you greater than the power within<br>
  you. If through a system of practice, conditions within you became such that every constructive<br>
  thought automatically out-pictured, you would be master of all conditions or circumstances<br>
  that in any way concerned you or affected your life. Would you not?<br>
  <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 13</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p> The next step in your instructions is this: The consciousness or fixed picture in mind of<br>
  anything, any condition, any circumstance, is the actual thing itself and what you experience<br>
  through the five senses is the mental picture out-pictured, or made visible or tangible<br>
  identically the same as the artist who puts his mental pictures upon the canvas; the hand, in his<br>
  case, being merely the instrument through which the mind expresses and which is under the<br>
  guidance and direction of the mind.<br>
  Does not medical science agree that the human body undergoes a complete change every<br>
  eleven months? This means that the cells of which your entire body is composed die and are<br>
  passed off at such a rate that you do not possess as little as one cell of the body you had a year<br>
  ago. You remember many years back, do you not? Many happenings of your childhood can be<br>
  recalled to memory. How can you remember back through those many years when your brain is<br>
  not yet a year old? Because you are mind. You are not body.<br>
  As an individual entity, functioning in an individual sphere, which is true of each one of us, you<br>
  are all-powerful Mind and your body is the vehicle through which you function. You are<br>
  master and your body is your servant. It is your instrument of expression. That is all.<br>
  Now, which is the real body—the one that remains pictured or imaged forever in mind as long<br>
  as you exist here, or the one that decays in its entirety and passes into the earth every eleven<br>
  months? And which are the real things—those things imaged or pictured in mind, or those<br>
  things seen in the outer and which disintegrate after a short existence?<br>
  Right here I do not wish to have you misled into the impression that the outer is of little or no<br>
  importance in human achievement, but it is only secondary, while a fundamental knowledge of<br>
  the operation of mind is of primary importance to you at the start.<br>
  I wish it were possible to explain, so that you might understand, the process by which a picture<br>
  in mind becomes objectified, but it would require hours to even make an effort in this direction,<br>
  and then I might only confuse you. For words are feeble things when one attempts to explain<br>
  these deeper things of Universal Law. One really must gradually and patiently advance up to<br>
  and into them to understand. However, it is not necessary to know this in order to use the law<br>
  any more than it is necessary to know the law by which the sun’s rays are transmitted to earth<br>
  in order to enjoy them. You have faith in my sincerity of purpose. Very well, place the same<br>
  amount of faith in the power of this law and anything you undertake will be possible of<br>
  accomplishment. Let us get on to the next step.<br>
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV<br>
  You may have heard it said that there are many minds, but such a statement is merely an idiom.<br>
  There is nothing in science or reality to support such a predicate. There is but one mind, as<br>
  there is but one electricity, one air or atmosphere. The many minds referred to are but a<br>
  multiplicity of expressions of the one. We use mind as we use air or electricity—as our<br>
  individual needs require.<br>
  I will now ask that you bear with me for a time while I make use of a contradiction in order that<br>
  I may simplify the next subject. It becomes necessary for me to refer to three minds, or, <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 14<br>
  properly speaking, three phases of mind.<br>
  You are apparently made up of three minds. The one which controls the functioning of the<br>
  body and which, for want of a better word, I will call the deeper mind. This mind we are not<br>
  particularly concerned with, and properly should not be. It knows its duties better than we do.<br>
  We can cooperate with this mind to our great profit in both health and strength by keeping our<br>
  thoughts off the body. By forgetting that we have a body and thereby refraining from<br>
  interfering with the proper functioning of this deeper mind, we will find that it will get along<br>
  very nicely.<br>
  The other two minds in which we are greatly interested and with which we must deal from this<br>
  time forth, are what I might name the Inner and Outer minds.<br>
  Those two minds you will readily recognize from the fact that when you take sides within<br>
  yourself upon a subject and find yourself carrying on a spirited controversy with yourself, you<br>
  are engaging these two minds.<br>
  The proper office of the Outer mind, which is in touch with external things through the<br>
  medium of the five senses, is to transmit its desires to the Inner mind, which is the seat of<br>
  power within you and which, by its very nature, has no consciousness of duality, since it has no<br>
  faculty of discrimination. It knows no impossible, no failure, no obstacle, or limit or lack. It<br>
  depends upon the guidance of the Outer mind and throws it’s great, unlimited force into<br>
  anything that the Outer mind may direct.<br>
  I can better illustrate the character of the Inner mind by again comparing it with electricity. As<br>
  electricity is the greatest power in the world, so is the Inner mind the greatest power in your<br>
  being. Of themselves, neither operates independently, but depends upon a separate agency to<br>
  incite them to action, and both bring helpful or harmful results according to the wisdom or<br>
  ignorance with which they are directed.<br>
  This being true, how important, then, for the Outer to unite with the Inner and cooperate with<br>
  it, and if this were the condition in human affairs, man would be master of his environment<br>
  instead of being the slave of circumstance.<br>
  Why are all not super-men instead of merely men? For this reason: The Outer mind forms a<br>
  desire which is automatically taken up by the Inner mind and, in turn, it immediately proceeds<br>
  to function toward bringing it forth. It scarcely has time to turn its great force in that direction<br>
  before the Outer has found a new fancy or has conjured up illusionary obstacles, and the Inner,<br>
  not being on the surface, not in contact with outer things and consequently dependent upon<br>
  the Outer for guidance, is forced to again divert its power. And thus it goes, on and on, like<br>
  leaks in a steam pipe, scattering its wonderful power everywhere but getting nowhere.<br>
  Why the Inner mind is thus thwarted in every move it makes toward accomplishment? Why?<br>
  Because the Outer judges everything by what the eye and ear reports and transmits that<br>
  message to the Inner. What do we find humanity doing? We find them taking pictures of what<br>
  they experience daily in the outer world, developing the sensitized film, and then printing<br>
  those pictures upon themselves within. The procedure should be just the reverse.<br>
  I know whereof I speak when I say that we have been endowed with the capacity and the<br>
  power to create desirable pictures within and to find them automatically printed in the outer<br>
  world of our environment. And it is a simple process, as you will see later. When we can do this,<br>
  we have mastery. And not before.<br>
  Well, then, you would say, the need must be to discipline the Outer mind, since it seems to be <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 15<br>
  the offender. Just so. But since it meets up with thousands of experiences almost daily, ordinary<br>
  methods of training might require years to accomplish results. Or, at best, such training would<br>
  be a long-drawn-out process. There is a quicker and better way. A method which, when put into<br>
  operation, employs the usefulness of the Outer mind without taking into account its vacillating<br>
  willfulness. And the first step in this direction follows:</p>
<p>CHAPTER V<br>
  We will suppose that there is an urgent need for you to reach a certain town as quickly as<br>
  possible. When you step into your automobile, you naturally picture in mind a given point of<br>
  destination and turn your face in that direction. If that point be distant, you may become<br>
  diverted onto wrong roads many times, but upon noting this, you return and again take the<br>
  proper course, guided by what?—by the picture in mind of the place you are headed for,<br>
  and you get there.<br>
  You held to a set definite objective until you reached it. You held your objective or<br>
  destination in mind without any particular effort or strain and merely returned the car to the<br>
  proper road when you found that it had strayed, and you got there. Thus it is with us. A set<br>
  definite objective must be established if we are to accomplish anything in a big way.<br>
  What do I mean by establishing a set definite objective? Is it as simple as it sounds? No, not at<br>
  the start. Would you set your objective at a million immediately and start out thoughtlessly to<br>
  make it overnight? Yes, you might, if you have the capacity to see a million as an immediate<br>
  possibility. But this is quite rare. The wise thing to do is to grow to it as the marathon runner<br>
  begins by first running a mile. Then he goes two miles, then three. Thus he expands his capacity<br>
  to eventually cover the full distance.<br>
  Why is a set definite objective necessary? There are three reasons.<br>
  First—The Inner mind is the positive pole of your being, while the Outer is the negative pole, as<br>
  in geology the North Pole is the positive and the South Pole the negative. There must be a<br>
  positive and negative in everything in the universe in order to complete a circuit or circle,<br>
  without which there would be no activity, no motion. To illustrate this, there would be no<br>
  forward if we had no backward. There could be no up if there were no down. There never<br>
  could have been such a quality as good if there were no evil, so called. How could there have<br>
  been light without darkness? For us to be conscious of one thing, there must be another<br>
  opposite by which to compare it or it remains nonexistent to us.<br>
  Now, in everything that is obedient to Law, the positive dominates and governs and the<br>
  negative serves. But mankind re-verses this. The Outer mind looks out upon the world and<br>
  reports strife, competition, obstacles, impossibilities and similar conditions. Why? Because of<br>
  the absence of direction, it is left to wander with-out a purpose and thus, aimlessly wandering,<br>
  it accepts everything.<br>
  The set definite objective, firmly imaged or pictured in mind, immediately whips the Outer<br>
  into line by giving it a fixed duty to perform. This, automatically, without any effort on your<br>
  part, infuses into it the positive quality of the Inner mind, and since the law of the universe and,<br>
  therefore, also of your being, cannot change; negative conditions, including individuals, serve it<br>
  and therefore you. And again, automatically, positive conditions and individuals are attracted to<br>
  you as surely as the steel particles are attracted to the magnet. That is the first reason.<br>
  Second—the atmosphere, or ether, as we prefer to name it, is filled with millions upon millions <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 16<br>
  of thoughts which are forever in motion. The hundreds of stations in your country, all<br>
  broadcasting simultaneously, give you a slight idea of the thoughts in the air. Every human<br>
  being is a broadcasting station and everybody is a receiving set. This explains why I am able to<br>
  answer your questions instantly, before you have had to form them into words. The fact that I<br>
  have been getting your thoughts before you have expressed them and which have been<br>
  puzzling you, is now made clear. This is a faculty developed after years of training. This faculty<br>
  was always in me and is within you. I have brought out and made use of mine, while yours lies<br>
  dormant almost entirely.<br>
  To get back to our subject. The man who has no set definite objective is tuning in to<br>
  everything and getting nothing. He is unfortunate indeed, for he is at the mercy of millions of<br>
  conflicting thoughts and his is a life of confusion and distress. Some of those in my work have so<br>
  perfected themselves that they are able to see these thoughts by virtue of the same law<br>
  developed in themselves, by which you will soon be enjoying motion pictures transmitted to<br>
  you over the radio. Therefore, we know what we are talking about when we speak of the chaos<br>
  of thoughts in the air.<br>
  On the other hand, the man who has a set definite objective deliberately tunes in to one<br>
  thing, which action automatically makes him positive and consequently wipes out the others.<br>
  If it is money he wants, he gets it. If it is position he wants, he gets it. Nothing that such a man<br>
  tunes in to can be withheld from him.<br>
  Third—When you set your mind upon anything, whether it be small or large, a pencil, a hat,<br>
  automobile, a home or great riches; whether it be tangible like these or intangible, such as an<br>
  education, a profession or travel, you transfer a portion of your life force to that thing, or how<br>
  could it be otherwise drawn to you? And you continue to nourish it as long as it is held in mind,<br>
  and the intensity of your desire governs the power with which the force is directed.<br>
  So you can see that were even a positive man to direct his force at several objectives, that<br>
  force becomes divided and each objective receives but a feeble stimulus, resulting in slow<br>
  reaction or none at all. Have you a great ultimate goal to reach requiring the attainment of<br>
  lesser objectives on the way? Well, then, let the many lie inactive and direct your force at the<br>
  nearest or first, and that being accomplished, take up the next and thus follow on as they occur<br>
  in sequential order.<br>
  Have I now given you the Law in its entirety? Well, in a sense, I have. Then again, I have not. To<br>
  instruct one as to what to do is good, but to show one how to do it is better. It is not only<br>
  necessary that we learn how to attain, but we must also learn how to maintain. I will, therefore,<br>
  go further and give you an important requirement in successful achievement and that is<br>
  secretiveness.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p> Before I explain the value of Secretiveness, I will have to change from our subject at hand for a<br>
  while.<br>
  When you declare “I am,” “I will,” “I did,” you are making a most mighty and profound<br>
  utterance. There are very few who realize the power released when the “I” is expressed. Hear<br>
  the great proclamation, “I AM THAT I AM,” from the lips of the Prophet, which has lived and<br>
  rung out down the ages and which, when understood, unites each one with that impersonal, <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 17<br>
  universal power.<br>
  The body you have is personal, but the “I” you express is universal, for in all the universe there<br>
  is but one “I,” as in all the universe there is but one figure “1.” The other figures are but<br>
  multiples or derivatives of that “1.” The figure “7,” for instance, is the “1” repeated so many<br>
  times. It is the understanding of those in my work that the “I” is the root from which the figure<br>
  “1” has sprung.<br>
  From what I have said, you should be able to see this: That when you work in the “me”<br>
  consciousness (Outer mind), you are working from the personal, limited standpoint. When you<br>
  work in the “I” consciousness (Inner mind), you invoke and receive the help of the impersonal,<br>
  unlimited resources of the universe. Well, you ask, How am I to arrive at this state? Easily, I will<br>
  say. For by merely following the system of practice that I am outlining, you naturally gravitate<br>
  into it unknowingly.<br>
  Now listen attentively: If there is but one “I” and you cannot express yourself without using it,<br>
  it follows that as far as you individually are concerned, there must be but one “you.” You do<br>
  not get this clearly? Well, did you ever apply the pronoun “I” to any other human being? Of<br>
  course you did not. You could not. You might say ‘‘he,’’ ‘‘she,’’ ‘‘they,””you,” “we,” but never<br>
  “I.” For there is but one “I” and that is you. And I say there is but one “you.” Yes, applied<br>
  individually, there is but one “you.” We will suppose that through a slight accident, you were to<br>
  be rendered unconscious for five minutes. During that period the world would cease to exist. It<br>
  would be absolutely wiped out. But, you will say, it would go on just the same. Yes, but without<br>
  your consciousness of it, it is not; it is non-existent. Proving that there is but one You.<br>
  Since the great and mighty “I” is, when expressed individually, none other than yourself, you<br>
  can see what power you have at your command. You can see what a wonderful being you are.<br>
  You can see that you are now a master, not yet developed perhaps, but the qualities are there<br>
  awaiting unfoldment and use.<br>
  If you do not clearly understand what I have just given, pass it by for this time and let us go on<br>
  to the next. You can later reason it out for yourself and see the truth of it.<br>
  You might question the value of such detailed explanation, but I have a purpose and that<br>
  purpose is to force you to think, to think deeply, with intensity. Right here I would not have you<br>
  confuse the word intensity with tenseness. Tenseness implies mental strain and arises out of<br>
  fear and anxiety. It is destructive to both mind and body. My use of intensity here suggests<br>
  mental force or power and its results are constructive.<br>
  You know thus far that progress depends upon the degree of sustained intensity in a given<br>
  direction. And you know that progress is very rapid these days. We must travel as rapidly as the<br>
  world or give up, and when we give up we immediately begin to retrograde. To enjoy enduring<br>
  success we should travel a little in advance of the world.<br>
  The persistent inner urge in the race mind to reach an objective more speedily, eventually<br>
  crystallized and out-pictured it-self in the form of an automobile, which was the first big step in<br>
  fast transportation for general use. But since it is the nature of Mind to forever reach out for<br>
  greater achievement, the airplane came into being in obedience to the mind of man to find a<br>
  way faster and not subject to the obstacles incident to automobile travel. And thus Mind moves<br>
  and thus it will move forever.<br>
  Open your eyes and look about you. Cannot you discern the trend? Mind is forever reaching<br>
  out and has not stopped at the airplane as a rapid mode of travel. I hesitate to tell you what the <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 18<br>
  next great step in this direction will be, but I will tell you this: Mind is so rapidly coming into its<br>
  own, that in the not far distant future, the man who knows the law and uses it will be supreme<br>
  and the ignorant one who refuses to see this will just remain in bondage to his false beliefs.<br>
  How important, then, to learn the law of thinking things through rather than follow the<br>
  time-worn method of attempting to force them through. One is mastery and the other slavery.<br>
  Returning to the subject, the value of secretiveness lies in the fact that, being impersonal and<br>
  universal, the “I” throws its power in with whatever words it is coupled, and when your plans<br>
  are expressed in words verbally, they become released and their force is spent. The Outer mind<br>
  has found a way of escape and your purpose has lost its necessary momentum.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p> The next requisite I might term your Nourishment or Reserve. We know that few are capable of<br>
  sustained effort, and that is the reason why we have comparatively few outstanding successes.<br>
  You have learned that your great power lies not upon the surface but deep within your being, in<br>
  your Inner mind. The average human lives upon the surface, ignorant of his great interior<br>
  power. Placing what little faith he has, in the Outer mind, he is governed by its false reports,<br>
  and as a result he is constantly in a turmoil of con-fusion, strife and strain until he succumbs,<br>
  discouraged and disheartened, broken in health and spirit.<br>
  Why is this so? Why is it a common expression that a man who accumulates wealth pays<br>
  dearly for it in health and vitality? Because, as I have already told you, when he intensifies upon<br>
  a given objective, he automatically transfers to it a portion of his vital life force. This is all very<br>
  well and necessary, but such a practice continued, with no replenishment to keep that life force<br>
  nourished, drains it and the result is trouble.<br>
  It is your rightful heritage, your birthright, to have anything that you desire and without limit,<br>
  for, as I have said, you are in a sense the only one here, for yours is the only consciousness in<br>
  existence as far as you are concerned. You can never know another. Those things that you<br>
  desire were put here for you to use and enjoy. If not, why are they here? And since only you<br>
  can be conscious of your own individual desires, those things were placed here specifically for<br>
  you.<br>
  Yes, you may have riches and position and with them health and happiness, when you know<br>
  the law of your being and cooperate with it. I have no patience with the one who proclaims that<br>
  poverty is a blessing. Poverty is the greatest curse upon earth. The one who preaches such a<br>
  doctrine is untrue to himself, for, while such remarks are proceeding from his lips, the desire for<br>
  the good things of life is gnawing at his heart.<br>
  Knowing so well that each individual, being differently constituted, given the fundamental<br>
  principles of the Law, will each work it out somewhat differently, according to his own<br>
  particular inherent nature, I have purposely avoided referring to my method, so that you might<br>
  have your entire freedom of interpretation and decision. But since I feel prompted to do so, I<br>
  will give you a hint of how I work, advising that you let this not influence or change you in your<br>
  method, because of it having come from me. You cannot attain dominion patterning after<br>
  another, or following custom or tradition. Sheep and plodders do that. Masters and leaders<br>
  never do.<br>
  A painting would be a dull, uninteresting thing were the artist, in featuring a great oak tree, to <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 19<br>
  fail to include its natural surroundings of grass, brush, flowers, leaves, and possibly sky and<br>
  clouds. The true artist creates a faithful reproduction. Our methods are similar. While he places<br>
  his upon the canvas, I place mine within. He places the oak upon the canvas and gives it its<br>
  natural surroundings. I do the same. To bring his picture forth, he is compelled to concentrate<br>
  upon it to the exclusion of all else that would tend to draw him away from his purpose. So am I.<br>
  At times something in the external suggests the picture to him. At other times inspiration<br>
  suggests it. It is the same with me. A hundred things in a day may come up to distract him and<br>
  attempt to draw him away, but with his picture uppermost, he does not resist those<br>
  distractions, but gives them their due attention and returns to the picture. Just so with me. His<br>
  picture completed, he begins another. I also do. For I am never consciously, mentally inactive.<br>
  Inactivity is retrogression.<br>
  Should I desire the presence of my servant at this moment, I would see him before me in my<br>
  mind picture surrounded by what is within my vision here and shortly the picture out-pictures.<br>
  Were I to desire wealth, I would surround that picture with all of wealth’s natural<br>
  accompaniments of conditions and possessions that would instinctively present themselves for<br>
  inclusion. I would get my suggestions, if necessary, from the out-picturing or externalized<br>
  picture of another’s success. I would go about my du-ties as usual. It matters little what I<br>
  appear to be doing in the outer. It matters much what I am doing within.<br>
  If I were a beginner and desired, for instance, a new automobile or home, I would select a<br>
  picture in colors of the one or closely resembling the one I desired, from a trade or home<br>
  periodical, and place it where it would meet my eyes frequently. This would tend to hold the<br>
  Outer mind in line and hasten the out-picturing of my idea.</p>

<p>PERSISTENCE</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>ACHIEVEMENT</p>
<p>MASTERY</p>
<p>DOMINION</p>
<p> After the day’s activities devoted to your ordinary duties and affairs and the consequent<br>
  devitalization of your life force, more or less, it is well to set apart an hour or half hour, as your<br>
  judgment might dictate, each evening when you can be alone and undisturbed, and in the quiet<br>
  and stillness of your own being, take each word separately down the list, or if you feel so<br>
  disposed, select such words from the list as you feel your particular needs require at the time.<br>
  Firmly impress your being with each word and at the same time, interpreting its meaning<br>
  and its effect upon you, not necessarily in the terms of it’s generally accepted meaning, but<br>
  strictly as it appeals to you.<br>
  Although I am continually impressing you with the fact that you are the “I,” the power in your<br>
  world, and that you are to stand upon your own two feet firmly and live it—not particularly<br>
  display it, but live it—(great characters shrink from display and publicity because of the<br>
  littleness of it). Yet I do not advise that the declaration “I am” be used in connection with these<br>
  words unless you are at the time in a positive frame of mind; unless you have a full conviction<br>
  of what you are repeating.<br>
  To declare, for example, “I am Power,” lays the Inner mind open to attack from the Outer in<br>
  the form of denial or doubt. Whereas, when the words only are repeated, they do not take<br>
  upon themselves the nature of a declaration, and consequently the Outer mind has not been<br>
  given the opportunity to become aroused in op-position.<br>
  To simplify explanation of your right attitude during this practice, I might say that keeping your<br>
  thoughts off the body and off external affairs and things, automatically places you in the ideal<br>
  mood. Of course, the Outer mind will wander and bring up hundreds of things, hundreds of<br>
  times, but like the automobile that I mentioned becoming diverted on to the wrong road, you<br>
  bring it back and bring it back, each time setting it on the right road. This wandering propensity<br>
  of the Outer mind will gradually lessen during these periods and you will find yourself becoming<br>
  a master of concentration.<br>
  There should be no strain, striving, anxiety or concern connected with this practice. You devote<br>
  each evening, unless otherwise taken up by occasional business, social or family duties, to<br>
  allowing these words to sink in and penetrate your being and like drops of pure water<br>
  entering a vessel of impure water, drop by drop the non-essentials are forced out and the<br>
  essentials remain.<br>
  These powerful words, acting upon you (your being) in the same way that food does upon your<br>
  body, automatically find their own needed places and uses within, in the same manner as do<br>
  the elements in the food which you eat, and you should not look for results from this practice <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 22<br>
  any more than you look for results from what you eat daily. You are to practice this system<br>
  every evening as regularly and diligently as your affairs will permit and then forget them<br>
  entirely until the next evening. They will be doing their work below the surface unknown to<br>
  you, but their effects will show forth in you and your affairs.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p> Approaching the close of your instructions, I believe it well to outline an example of procedure<br>
  for you. Since, as I have previously said, words are often so inadequate to convey the proper<br>
  meaning when dealing with a subject of this kind, I will approach facts from different angles for<br>
  better elucidation.<br>
  Here is an example: Invoking the aid of this law, neither money, friends or influence are<br>
  necessary to the attainment of whatever your heart is set upon.<br>
  Whether you are a banker, a clerk or a bootblack. It is no respecter of person or position.<br>
  Whether your ambition lies in direct line with the position you are now occupying, or whether it<br>
  necessitates an entire change from what you are doing. You may have no definite plan in life<br>
  except the fact that you want to get ahead. Since all the desire in the world will get you<br>
  nowhere, it becomes necessary that a definite objective be first arrived at and then firmly<br>
  established within.<br>
  After intelligent deliberation you decide upon one Supreme Goal. It is distant, perhaps, but the<br>
  glorious assurance is that it can be attained. What is your first step? If a banker or merchant, is<br>
  it a definite increase in volume monthly? Or, if an employee, is it a position above? There, you<br>
  have your first and nearest objective in the direction of your Supreme Objective.<br>
  When the first objective is reached, what then? Set another one beyond that, immediately.<br>
  Why? Because the peculiar nature of the Outer mind is to drop back into inertia after being<br>
  forced through to an objective. You can imagine the Outer mind reflecting something after this<br>
  fashion: “Well, I have been mercilessly whipped about and forced through to that thing, but I<br>
  reached it and now I will have a rest.” And your answer will be: “No rest for you, for I have<br>
  already started you upon another.” Because, once having attained that valuable momentum,<br>
  maintain it. Cling to it. And as the momentum increases, the steps in your progress become<br>
  more rapid, until eventually it will be possible to reach an objective almost immediately, as is<br>
  the practice of those in my work.<br>
  The course followed in bringing forth your objective can be likened exactly to the process that<br>
  takes place in a seed. Being fixed in the darkness of the soil, it proceeds to express or outpicture<br>
  the exact picture held within its life cell and, in obedience to law, it sends up a shoot<br>
  seeking the light. At the same time, it sends down roots seeking nourishment. If, on the way<br>
  up, that shoot encounters obstacles in any form, it does not attempt to force them out of its<br>
  way. It travels around them. If the roots fail to find the required nourishment, it<br>
  withers away. If all goes well, it blossoms forth and, having reached its goal, a seed is<br>
  again dropped and the process repeated. Bear in mind that the actual process takes place in<br>
  darkness, beneath the surface. Thus it is with us. That is where all great and important ideas are<br>
  developed.<br>
  Now, are you going to cast glances out of the corner of your eye to see how the thing is<br>
  proceeding? Are you going to set to wondering how the thing works, or if it really is working? <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 23<br>
  Not at all. You set the objective. You therefore planted the seed. You would not dig up a seed in<br>
  your garden to see if it were sprouting. You planted and watered it and are satisfied that,<br>
  according to the law of its being, it will come forth. Likewise, nothing upon earth can prevent<br>
  your objective from becoming externalized, because nothing in the world can nullify Universal<br>
  Law. You plant the seed idea. You hold it there. You nourish it. You have done your part. Trust<br>
  the Law to do its part.<br>
  Will you encounter resistance? Oh, yes. Your activity creates it. Why? Because action requires<br>
  reaction to support it. Resistance is the negative pole of action or activity, the positive pole as<br>
  you have already heard, and you need both. If there were no resistance, action would be<br>
  nonexistent.<br>
  It is resistance that keeps the airplane soaring. Without resistance, it could not fly. Neither<br>
  could the birds; or the fish swim; or you walk. As the power of the engine increases, the greater<br>
  the momentum of the airplane and the greater the resistance necessary to support it. The<br>
  greater the momentum, the greater the altitude or height possible to attain. With the decrease<br>
  in engine power comes the decrease in momentum and the consequent dropping of the plane.<br>
  This is an example for us. Momentum must be attained and then maintained if we are to<br>
  reach the heights of achievement. And the work is delightful after the apparent difficulty of the<br>
  first steps are passed. For there is nothing more joyous than the satisfaction of having achieved<br>
  something worthwhile.<br>
  Are you to recognize resistance in any guise? No. For, if you recognize it as a power opposed to<br>
  your progress, you are resisting it, therefore you automatically acknowledge it as a power<br>
  greater than you, for no lesser power can retard the progress of a greater one. That is plain.<br>
  And going further, remember this great truth: Whoever or whatever you resist, be it in thought,<br>
  word or action; be it in the form of criticism, envy, jealousy, hatred or otherwise, you most<br>
  assuredly help, and you weaken yourself proportionately. Why? Because you have<br>
  deliberately taken a portion of your precious life force so necessary to your progress, and<br>
  transferred it to that person or thing. Have you not witnessed the case at times, of one<br>
  becoming exhausted after a “fit of rage” over another? Exhaustion is depletion. And to deplete<br>
  means to empty. Something went out. Yes, to the other person to his profit and the other’s<br>
  loss. This is an example of the transfer of life force in a violent form. You are very fortunate in<br>
  having learned this wisdom. Now, by all means, practice it.<br>
  CHAPTER X</p>
<p> What then should be your daily attitude? What is the attitude of the wind as it speeds on its<br>
  way to its destination? It yields recognition to neither person, place or thing as having any<br>
  power to hinder it. The harm or the help it gives is measured only by the welfare of the<br>
  particular one it affects. It is aware of causing neither harmful nor helpful results, for it is<br>
  impersonal. The sun shines, the rain falls and the wind blows upon all alike. They choose no<br>
  particular persons or things to help or harm.<br>
  There is your lesson. You are not to be consciously aware of resisting or harming anyone in<br>
  your way as you speed along to your goal. Those who attempt to hinder you are helping you<br>
  and should be considered your friends. This is wisdom of the highest order. <br>
  The Message of a Master<br>
  http://www.lovehealthandmoney.com Page 24<br>
  Keeping the secret of your aspirations locked securely within you sets up antagonism in the<br>
  Outer mind, for due to its nature, it rebels against discipline and subjugation. That evident<br>
  weakness which stifled your great ambitions in the past is an illustration of the nature of this<br>
  Outer mind. That is its habitual trait.<br>
  Seeing that it is about to be deprived of its wanton freedom, it will, like a wild bull in a<br>
  stockade, seek to escape by every means except the way that you have provided. I am warning<br>
  you. It will bring up every sort of argument to bear upon the futility of your purpose. It will<br>
  tempt you to mention your plans and ambitions to others; to slow up in your activity; to doubt<br>
  the power of the law operating in your behalf. It will try every known conceivable way to thwart<br>
  you. And your answer to all this will be, “Obey. I am master here.” Stand as master of your own<br>
  being and hold your course steadfast to the goal.<br>
  You may be led through strange places and take circuitous routes at times, but let that not<br>
  disturb you. With the wisdom of the Inner mind at the helm, you are being led the quickest<br>
  way, although it might appear to be the longest.<br>
  This advice is necessary for you now as a beginner, but as you grow in practice you will find<br>
  that these qualities become a part of your very being. They then function automatically,<br>
  entirely without any conscious effort on your part.<br>
  What is the result? Due to the persistent holding to the goal and your absolutely air-tight<br>
  secretiveness, the Outer mind finds no escape for its increasing energy and in desperation it<br>
  plunges through, like the overload of steam through the safety valve of a boiler and your<br>
  objective is reached.<br>
  We have come to the close of your instructions. Go forth and practice what you know. Living<br>
  the law will make you a character of notice. People will be instinctively attracted to you both<br>
  upon the street and among your social and business associates, without knowing why. You will<br>
  become a mysterious being to the world. Let this not turn your head, but rather, in humble<br>
  gratitude, give thanks to the great Supreme Power that has made this possible.</p>
