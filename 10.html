<p>Alright, thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I’ve got about apparently I’ve got about five to six minutes to say the most useful things I can think of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m gonna do my best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was suggested that I distill things down to 3 items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I’ll go with four.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I’ll try, I think, I think these are pretty important ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of it may kinda sound like, well you’ve heard them before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, you know, worth reemphasizing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I think the first is, you need to work, if you, depending on how well you want to do,&nbsp;</p>
<p>particularly if you want to start a company, you need to work super hard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is super hard mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, when my brother and I were starting our first company, instead of getting an apartment,&nbsp;</p>
<p>we just rented a small office and we slept on the couch and we showered in the YMCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re so hard up that we had just one computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the website was up during the day, and I was coding at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7 days a week, all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I, sort of briefly had a girlfriend in that period and in order to be with me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>she had to sleep in the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, work hard, like, every waking hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s the thing I would say, particularly if you’re starting a company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I mean, if you do the simple math, you say like somebody else is working 50 hours a week and&nbsp;</p>
<p>you’re working 100, you’ll get twice as done, as much done, in the course of the year as the other company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other thing I’d say is that if you’re creating a company, or if you’re joining a company,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the most important thing is to attract great people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So either be with, join a group that’s amazing, that you really respect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, if you’re building a company, you’ve got to gather great people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, all a company is is a group of people that have gathered together to create a product or service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So depending upon how talented and hard working that group is,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and to the degree in which they are focused cohesively in a good direction,&nbsp;</p>
<p>that will determine the success of the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, do everything you can to gather great people, if you’re creating a company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then, I’d say focus on signal over noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of companies get confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They spend a lot of money on things that don’t actually make the product better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for example, at Tesla, we’ve never spent any money on advertising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve put all the money into R and D and manufacturing and design to try and make the car as good as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, I think that’s the way to go. For any given company, keep thinking about,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Are, these efforts that people are expending, are they resulting in a better product or service?"</p>
<p>And if they’re not, stop those efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the final thing is, is to sort of, don’t just follow the trend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you may have heard me say that it’s good to thinking terms of the physics approach, the first principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With is, rather than reasoning by analogy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>you boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine, and then you reason up from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is a good way to figure out if something really makes sense, or is it just what everybody else is doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s hard to think that way, you can’t think that way about everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes a lot of effort. But if you’re trying to do something new, it’s the best way to thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that framework was developed by physicists to figure out counter intuitive things, like quantum mechanics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s really a powerful, powerful method.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And anyways, so that’s, and then the final thing I would encourage you to do is now is the time to take risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don’t have kids, you’re obligations, well! Some of you… Hahaha, you probably don’t have kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as you get older, your obligations start to increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, and, once you have a family, you start taking risks not just for yourself, but for your family as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It gets harder to do things that might not work out. So now is the time to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you have those obligations. So I would encourage you to take risks now, and to do something bold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won’t regret it</p>
<p>. Thank you....</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>...I don’t know if it was helpful. Great.</p>
