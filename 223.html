Introduction
Leibniz, Caroline, Newton, and Clarke
   ln November of 1715, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the elderly librar-
ian, historian, and counselor to the House of Hanover in Lower Saxony,
wrote a letter to Caroline, Princess of Wales, cautioning her about the
odd cosmological-theological views of Sir Isaac Newton and his followers.
This would seem an unusual event in international relations except that
Leibniz had a long-standing relationship with Caroline, who was married
to Georg August. The latter was Prince of Wales, Elector Prince of
Hanover, and son of Leibniz's employer, Georg Ludwig, Elector of
Hanover 1 who, from 1714 on, was George I, King of Great Britain and
Ireland. Caroline became Queen Consort in 1727 when Georg August
ascended to the throne of England as George 11;2 she was the third of
three royal women who had befriended Leibniz. 3 The whole court of
Hanover had moved to London in 1714. However, Leibniz was not wel-
come there. Georg Ludwig had refused his request to join the royal family
in England. The official reason was that he was to stay in Hanover until
the history of the House of Hanover, which he was commissioned to
write, was closer to completion.4 By 1714 there was great hostility at the

  l. Elector Georg Ludwig was the third of Leibniz's employers in Hanover
(from 1698 to Leibniz's death in 1716), the first having been Duke Johann P reid-
rich who first retained Leibniz (from 1676 to 1679) and the second his brother
Duke, then Elector, Ernst August (Leibniz's employer from 1679 to 1698 and
Georg Ludwig's father).
  2. Caroline was the mother ofFrederick Louis, Prince of Wales, and thus grand-
mother of George III, "Old King George" of the American Revolution. For more
on Caroline and the context for the correspondence, see Domenico Bertoloni Meli,
"Caroline, Leibniz, and Clarke," Journal ofthe History ofIdeas 60 (1999): 469-S6.
  3. Including Georg Ludwig's sister Sophia Charlotte, Electress of Branden-
burg, then Queen ofPrussia, and his mother Sophia, Electress ofHanover.
   4. Ernst August had asked Leibniz to write a history of the House ofHanover
in the 1680s. Leibniz took on the task with his customary zealand optimism, that
is, he took on much more than he could reasonably accomplish. The only fmished
manuscript of the history he left behind was its first volume, Protogaea, a treatise
on natural history or geology. Leibniz intended to preface his history with a dis-
sertation on the state of Germany as it was prior to all histories, taking as evidence
the natural monuments, shells petrified in earth, and stones with the imprint of
fish or plants. He contemplated continuing his history by treating the oldest known


                                                                                   vu

court to the then elderly counselor. He was often a subject of ridicule,
treated as an old fossil, with his enormous black wig and once fashionable
ornate clothes. The court may have been unhappy with his failure to finish
the history of the House of Hanover,5 but it was also surely embarrassed
by the protracted debate between him and Newton over the discovery of
the calculus, which had taken on decidedly nationalistic overtones.6
   Admittedly, the debate about the priority of the invention of the cal-
culus was not the only controversy of the final period of Leibniz' s life,
but it was certainly the most bitter. The first public blow in the dispute
was probably delivered by Fatio de Dullier, who wrote an article in 1697
attributing the discovery to Newton and attacking Leibniz. The feud

people, then the different peoples that succeeded one another, their languages, and
the mixtures of these languages, to the extent that they can be judged by etymolo-
gies. The origins of the House would have begun with Charlemagne and continued
with the Emperors descended from him and with the five Emperors of the House
of Brunswick, encompassing the ancient history of Saxony through the House of
Witikind, ofUpper Germany through the House of the Guelfs, and ofLombardy
through the Houses of the Dukes and Marquis ofTuscany and Liguria, thus trac-
ing the descent of the Princes of Brunswick. After these origins would have come
the genealogy of the House of the Guelfs, with a short history up to the seven-
teenth century; the genealogy would have been accompanied by those of the other
great Houses, including the House of the Ghibellines, ancient and modern Aus-
tria, and Bavaria. To accomplish his design and to amass sufficient materials, Leib-
niz scoured the whole of Germany, visited ancient abbeys, searched town archives,
and examined tombs and other antiquities. Although he never completed his his-
tory, we should not think that he balked at the project; one cannot look upon the
masses of corollary materials he did publish and think that he was not committed
to it. He left behind enough materials that G. H. Pertz, a Hanover librarian and
editor ofLeibniz's works, was able to put it all together and finally publish the his-
tory in four fat volumes during the nineteenth century.
   5. And perhaps other failures: Leibniz took on a wide variety of tasks for the
court at Hanover. One of his initial tasks was as min ing engineer, supervising the
d rain ing of the silver mines in the Harz mountains. His plan was to use the power
of air, for which he designed windmills, gearing mechanisms, and suction pumps.
It all ended up in de feat, Leibniz believing that he was undermined by various low-
er administrators and workers who feared that the technology would cost them
their jobs.
   6. lt does not take much imagination to see that the Court of Hanover might
have had divided loyalties between their German past and their English future; it
is clear that they wanted to look more English as they became the Royal Court.
Leibniz, as a German disputant in a controversy with the English Newtonians,
would not have fitted well into their plans. For a discussion of such issues, see E. J.
Aiton, Leibmz: A Biography (Bristol: A. Hilger, 1985).
Introduction                                                                       lX



simmered, and in 1711 Leibniz complained to the Royal Society about an
accusation by John Keill, another Newtonian, that Leibniz had stolen
Newton's calculus. 7 ln 1712 the Society declared that Leibniz did not
know anything of differential calculus before Newton revealed it to him
in a letter of 1672; that Newton invented the calculus in 1669, fifteen
years before Leibniz published his version of it in the Acta Eruditorum of
Leipzig; and that, consequently, Keill had not slandered Leibniz. The
Society made its findings public in its Commercium Epistolicum de Analysi
promota (mostly composed by Newton, as we now understand). The epi-
sode obviously had many repercussions up to Leibniz's death four years
later. Perhaps the only charitable thing one could say about it is that it
provides a glimpse into the workings of the Royal Society at the start of
the eighteenth century and illustrates its domination by Newton and the
N ewtonians. 8
    Newton (1642-1727) was, of course, the foremost mathematician and
natural philosopher of the late seventeenth century. He attended Trinity
College, Cambridge, was elected Fellow in 1667, and succeeded Isaac Bar-
row as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669. Newton's great work,
Philosophiae natura/is principia mathematica (The Mathematical Princip/es
ofNatural Philosophy, referred to as the Principia), published in 1687 (2nd
ed. 1713; 3rd ed. 1726), was a revision and expansion of several treatises
he previously composed but did not publish. He was elected President of
the Royal Society in 1703 and knighted in 1705, the year after the publica-
tion of Optics. During his life he engaged in several bitter priority dis-
putes about scientific and mathematical discoveries-for example, with
Robert Hooke in 1686--1688 over the inverse square law and, of course,
with Leibniz over the calculus. His influence in the history of science is
unequaled. 9

Keill had acted without Newton's knowledge.

    When Leibniz wrote to Caroline cautioning her about Newton's views,
he surely did not expect to elicit a reply from Newton. But by the end of
the month, on November 26, 1715, he had received a letter written by
Samuel Clarke on behalf of Newton. This resulted in a series of four more
letters by Leibniz and four more replies by Clarke, the exchange being cut
short by Leibniz's death on November 14, 1716. There is always a linger-
ing question of authorship in Clarke's letters: were they really Clarke's or
were they composed by Newton? Clarke was obviously Newton's stand-
in, but was he also merely a mouthpiece? Enzio Vailati, the author of a
recent commentary on the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, reviews the
arguments both pro and con:

     First, the documentary evidence about Newton's role in the correspon-
     dence is scant at best. There are neither drafts of Clarke's letters to Leibniz
     by Newton nor letters between Clarke and Newton that might help in
     assessing the latter's role in the correspondence. Since Clarke was Newton's
     parish priest at St. James, Picadilly, they were neighbors, which rendered
     epistolary exchanges unlikely.... We know that Newton played some indi-
     rect role in the correspondence. There is a copy in Newton's hand of the
     postscript on atoms and void to Oarke's fourth letter, and almost certainly
     Clarke consulted some of his papers in drafting the physical arguments that
     make up much of the notes in his fifth letter; but whether Newton played a
     direct role, and if so what its extent and depth were, is unclear at best. 10

The author goes on to state that Clarke's views coincided with Newton's
and that Newton's influence on Clarke was great, but that "all the philo-
sophical positions and most of the arguments Clarke aired in the corre-
spondence had appeared in his 1705-1706 Boyle Lectures, in previous
epistolary exchanges with Collins (1707-1708) and Butler (1714-1715),
and in philosophical ser mons." 11 All of that is su rely right, and Vailati's
emphasis in reestablishing Clarke as a philosopher who should be stu died
seriously is certainly welcome. Still, there is no doubt that Clarke was
Newton's agent and that he would not have written anything that he knew

was not in keeping with Newton's views. The relationship between Clarke
and Newton was too close to think of Clarke as independent. That was
also how Caroline saw it. ln the letter she wrote to Leibniz on January l O,
1716, enclosed with Clarke's Second Replies, she said:

   I enclose a reply to your paper; I considered very carefully the replies made
   on both sides. I do not know whether the bias I have for your merit makes
   me partial, but I find all his replies are rather words than what could be
   called replies. You are right about the author of the reply; they are not writ-
   ten without the advice of Sir Newton, whom I should like to be reconciled
   with you. I do not know if you will consent, but the Abbe Conti and myself
   have made ourselves mediators; it would be a great pity if two such great
   men as you and he were to be estranged by misunderstandingsY

lronically, Leibniz had previously asked about the possibility of translat-
ing the Theodicy into English and Caroline had written to him on Novem-
ber 14, 1715, saying: "l have talked today with the Bishop of Lincoln
about the translation of your Theodicy; he assures me that there is no one
capable of doing it except Dr. Clarke, whose books I sent you by Oeyn-
hausen. He is a close friend of Sir Newton. " 13 But less than two weeks
later, in the letter in which she enclosed Clarke's First Reply, Caroline said:

   I hope you received the books I sent you. Send me, please, your opinion on
   Dr. Clarke's works, which I think have considerable merit, although not
   comparable to your Theodicy. .. . We are thinking seriously of getting your
   Theodicy translated; but we are looking for a good translator. Dr. Clarke is
   too opposed to your opinions to do it; he would certainly be the most suit-
   able person of all, but he is too much of Sir Isaac Newton's opinion and I am
   myself engaged in a dispute with him. 14

Caroline's opinion of Clarke was clearly correct: he was an excellent trans-
lator of philosophy and science but he was too much of the Newtonian.
    Samuel Clarke (16 75-1729) was educate d at Gonville and Caius Col-
lege, Cambridge, receiving his B.A. in 1695. lt was said that he was one of
the first to master Newton's Principia. ln 1697 he translated into Latin
the Traite de physique of the Cartesian Jacques Rohault, adding extensive
footnotes "correcting" Descartes by incorporating Newtonian principles.
lt became the standard physics textbook in English schools and thereby
the conduit through which Newtonian principles were taught-it was

itself translated into English, footnotes and all, by John Clarke (1682-
1757) in 1723. Samuel Clarke also published several theological works
and sermons and was involved in various theological disputes (including
the one with Henry Dodwell over the immortality of the soul mentioned
in the correspondence). He gave the Boyle lectures in 1704 and 1705. ln
1706 he translated Newton's Optics into Latin. But perhaps he is best
known now for his correspondence with Leibniz, in which he and Leib-
niz had a wide-ranging discussion of the nature of God, human souls,
free will and indifference of choice, space and time, the vacuum, mira-
eles, and matter and force.
   These philosophical topics have always been important, but they took
on an even greater significance in the seventeenth century, when philoso-
phers had to reconsider their fundamental doctrines in the light of the
scientific revolution that was taking place. New scientific and philosophi-
cal doctrines had emerged, posing a challenge to the Aristotelian (or scho-
lastic) philosophy, which had dominated European thought ever since the
thirteenth century when the majority of the Aristotelian corpus was red is-
covered, translated from Greek and Arabic into Latin, and made compat-
ible with Christian doctrine. The substantial forms and primary matter of
the scholastics were giving way to a new mechanistic world of geometrical
bodies, corpuscles, or atoms in motion. Old problems that seem ed to have
been resolved within a scholastic framework were raised again with new
urgency. Leibniz, of course, was a major contributor to this intellectual
movement, which defined the modem world.
    Leibniz (1646--1716) attended the universities of Leipzig (1661-1666)
and Altdorf (1666--1667), graduating with degrees in law and philosophy.
Invited to join the faculty at Altdorf, he chose instead to enter the service
of the Elector of Mainz. ln 1672 he was sent on diplomatic business to
Paris. While in Paris, he read and copied Rene Descartes's manuscripts
and sought out proponents of the new philosophy, including Antoine
Arnauld and Nicholas Malebranche; his own later work was often precip-
itated by the correspondence he maintained with them. He traveled to
London and met members of the Royal Society (Henry Oldenburg and
Robert Boyle, among others, though not Newton). Leibniz returned to
Germany, in 1676, in the service of the court of Hanover, where he
resided until his death. His literary output was massive, but he did not
publish much of what he wrote. Among his unpublished manuscripts
were such important works as "Discourse on Metaphysics" (1686),
Dynamics (1689-1691), and "Monadology" (1714). ln 1705 he finished
his New Essays on Human Understanding, a book-length commentary on
John Locke's Essay but did not issue the work. He usually wrote essays,
Introduction                                                                   Xlli


small treatises, and letters to learned correspondents. With the rise of
intellectual journals in the second half of the seventeenth century, he had
a ready means of disseminating his thought. He did publish several signif-
icant philosophical articles: "New System of Nature" (Journal des Scav-
ants, 1695), "Specimen of Dynamics" (Acta Eruditorum, 1695), and "On
Nature Itself" (Acta Eruditorum, 1698). Ultimately, he published a book-
length volume, Theodicy (1710), though it is a rather loosely structured
work, consisting largely of responses to Pierre Bayle's skepticism. Leibniz
maintained an extensive circle of correspondents. 15
    The correspondence with Clarke took place during Leibniz's last few
years; as such, the doctrines it contains resemble those of the Theodicy
and "Monadology." In the exchange Leibniz is especially concerned to
defend the principle of sufficient reason as the basis for contingent truths,
as opposed to the principle of contradiction, which he asserts is the foun-
dation for necessary truths. 16 He also defends a number ofhis characteris-
tic theses: small perceptions which we do not consciously perceive, pre-
established harmony between the soul and the body, and especially the
identity of indiscernibles. 17 According to Leibniz, the thesis of the iden-
tity of indiscernibles would "put an end to such doctrines as the empty
tablets of the soul, a soul without thought, a substance without action,
void space, atoms, and even particles in matter not actually divided, com-
plete uniformity in a part of time, place, or matter . . . and a thousand
other fictions of philosophers which arise from their incomplete
notions" 18---doctrines which he disputed with Newton and Clarke.

editions of the Theodicy and New Essays in English translation (see the Abbrevia-

why it is, and why it is thus rather than otherwise"; principle of contradiction:
"that a proposition cannot be true and false at the same time, and that therefore A
is A and cannot be not A." See "Monadology," sec. 31-3, AG 217.

something over and above number."

Editor's Note
   Clarke accomplished most of the work for this edition. In 1717 he pub-
lished the correspondence between him and Leibniz as A Collection of
Papers which passed between the late Mr. Leibnitz and Dr. Clarke in the years
1715 and 1716 relating to the Princip/es of Natural Philosophy and Religion,
 in English and French on facing pages, with Leibniz's letters translated
 into English by him. He even translated and incorporated into the edition
some passages from Leibniz's (French and Latin) works that would illumi-
nate their exchanges. I have simply modernized Clarke's translation for an
American audience. l also checked his translation against Leibniz's origi-
nal language. Most of the modifications l made were minor, a result of
changing standards of spelling and punctuation. Other modifications, also
minor, had to do with various words we consider archaic; when Leibniz
talks about le mercure and taimant, Clarke's translations are "quicksilver"
and "the lodestone," whereas we would say "mercury" and "the magnet."
 Some of the revisions had to do with ambiguous terms in Enlightenment
English. Clarke uses the term want to mean need or lack, as in Leibniz's
"princip le of the want of a sufficient reason" or Newton's "until this sys-
tem wants a re formation" and his own "for want of gravity." We generally
restrict want to what agents do. I attempted to dispel this ambiguity, which
 does not occur in Leibniz's French. Leibniz's principle is that of a besoin
d' une raison suffisante, or of a "need for a sufficient reason." And when
 Clarke translates him as saying "for want of knowledge," he is translating
foute de connaissance, or "for lack of knowledge." There is a similar ambi-
 guity with the English verb pretend, which can mean either claim or feign.
Again, Leibniz's French is not ambiguous; he says je pretends les avoir etah-
 lis- " l claim"-not Clarke's "l pretend"-"to have established them,"
and On me /'avoit meme accorde, ou foit semblant de l'accorder-"The author
 granted it or pretended to grant it." Similar things may be said about alle-
guer, which does not have the connotation that a/lege has in a non-legal
context, but is more like advance or adduce. Perhaps the only major revi-
sion I made was to sort out Clarke's vocabulary as to the word perceive,
which he uses to translate indifferently Leibniz' s sentir, percevoir, apper-
 cevoir and representer. The first pair I left as "perceive," but translated
appercevoir as "consciously perceive" and representer as "represent"; see
my note to sec. 4 of Leibniz's Second Letter. Finally, other than this brief
Introduction, I added a few explanatory notes and an appendix with some
 portions of Newton's works that may be helpful toward understanding the
exchanges, especially as they are often referred to by Clarke.
     I wish to thank David Bruzina, for assisting me in establishing the text
and checking it against Clarke's published version, and Gregory Brown,

Clarke's Introduction
To Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales
    Madam,
    As the following letters were at first written by your command and had
afterwards the honor of being transmitted several times through Your
Royal Highness' hands, so the principal encouragement upon which they
now presume to appear in public is the permission they have of coming
forth under the protection of so illustrious a name.
    The late learned Mr. Leibniz understood well how great an honor and
reputation it would be to him to have his arguments approved by a person
of Your Royal Highness' character. But the same steady impartiality and
unalterable love of truth, the same constant readiness to hear and to sub-
mit to reason, always so conspicuous, always shining forth so brightly in
Your Royal Highness' conduct-which justly made him desirous to exert
in these papers his utmost skill in defending his opinions-was at the
same time an equal encouragement, to those who thought him in error, to
endeavor to prove that his opinions could not be defended.
    The occasion of his giving your Royal Highness the trouble of his first
letter, he declares to be his having entertained some suspicions that the
foundations of natural religion were in danger of being hurt by Sir Isaac
Newton's philosophy. It appeared to me, on the contrary, a most certain
and evident truth that, from the earliest antiquity to this day, the founda-
tions of natural religion had never been so deeply and so firmly laid as in
the mathematical and experimental philosophy of that great man. And
Your Royal Highness' singular exactness in searching after truth and ear-
nest concern for everything of real consequence to religion could not
permit those suspicions, which had been suggested by a gentleman of
such eminent note in the learned world as Mr. Leibniz was, to remain
unanswered.
    Christianity presupposes the truth of natural religion. Whatever sub-
verts natural religion does consequently much more subvert Christianity,
and whatever tends to confirm natural religion is proportionately of ser-
vice to the true interest of the Christian. Natural philosophy, therefore,
insofar as it affects religion by determining questions concerning liberty
and fate, concerning the extent of the powers of matter and motion and
the proofs from phenomena of God's continual goverrunent of the world,
is of very great importance. lt is of singular use to understand rightly and
distinguish carefully from hypotheses or mere suppositions the true and

                                                                          l

certain consequences of experimental and mathematical philosophy,
which do, with wonderful strength and advantage to all such as are capa-
ble of apprehending them, confirm, establish, and vindicate against all
objections those great and fundamental truths of natural religion, which
the wisdom of providence has at the same time universally implanted, in
some degree, in the minds of persons even of the meanest capacities not
qualified to examine demonstrative proofs.
   It is with the highest pleasure and satisfaction that the following
papers on so important a subject are laid before a Princess, who, to an
inimitable sweetness of temper, candor, and affability toward all, has
joined not only an impartial love of truth and a desire for promoting
learning in general, but has herself also attained to a very particular and
uncommon degree of knowledge, even in matters of the nicest and most
abstract speculation, and whose sacred and always unshaken regard to the
interest of sincere and uncorrupt religion made her the delight of all good
Protestants abroad, and by a just fame filled the hearts of all true Britons
at home with an expectation beforehand, which, great as it was, is fully
answered by what they now see and are blessed with.
   By the Protestant Succession in the illustrious house of Hanover hav-
ing taken place, this nation has now, with the blessing of God, a certain
prospect (if our own vices and follies do not prevent it) of seeing govern-
ment actually administered, according to the design and end for which it
was instituted by providence, with no other view than that of the pu blic
good, the general welfare and happiness of mankind. We have a prospect
of seeing the true liberty of a brave and loyal people, firmly secured,
established, and regulated by laws equally advantageous both to the crown
and subject; of seeing learning and knowledge encouraged and promoted,
in opposition to all kinds of ignorance and blindness; and (which is the
glory of all) of seeing the true Christian temper and spirit of religion
effectively prevail, both against atheism and infidelity on the one hand,
which take off from men all obligations of doing what is right, and against
superstition and bigotry on the other hand, which lay upon men the
strongest obligations to do the greatest wrongs.
   What views and expectations less than these can a nation reasonably
entertain, when it beholds a King firmly settled upon the throne of a
wisely limited monarchy, whose will, when without limitation always
showed a greater love of justice than of power, and never took pleasure in
acting otherwise than according to the most perfect laws of reason and
equity? When it sees a succession of the same blessings continued, in a
Prince, whose noble openness of mind and generous warmth of zeal for
the preservation of the Protestant religion and the laws and liberties of
these kingdoms, make him every day more and more beloved as he is more

known? And when these glorious hopes open still further into an
unbounded prospect in a numerous royal offspring? Through whom, that
the just and equitable temper of the grand father, the noble zeal and spirit
of the father, the affability, goodness, and judicious exactness of the
mother, may, with glory to themselves and with the happiest influences
both on these and foreign countries, descend to all succeeding genera-
tions; to the establishment of universal peace, of truth and right among
men; and to the entire rooting out that greatest enemy of Christian reli-
gion, the spirit of Popery both among Romanists and Protestants, and
that Your Royal Highness may yourself live long, to continue a blessing to
these nations, to see truth and virtue flourish in your own days, and to be
a great instrument under the direction of providence in laying a founda-
tion for the highest happiness of the pu blic in times to come, is the prayer
of, Madam, Your Royal Highness' most humble and most obedient ser-
vant, Samuel Clarke.


Advertisement to the Reader
   The reader will be pleased to observe,
    L That the following letters are all printed exactly as they were writ-
ten, without adding, diminishing, or altering a word. Only the marginal
notes and the Appendix were added. 1
   2. That the translation is made with great exactness to prevent any
misrepresentation of Leibniz's sense.
   3. That the numbers of sections in each of Clarke's letters refer respec-
tively to the numbers or sentences of each of Leibniz's immediately pre-
ceding letters. 2




   l. As Clarke states, he inserted an appendix with passages from Leibniz' s works
and added a large number of marginal references. We have reproduced the appen-
dix (as Appendix A) and incorporated the marginal references as footnotes or (in
the case of the section references from Clarke's Fifth Reply) in the text itself.
   2. Clarke added the section numbers to Leibniz's First and Second Letters and
to his own First and Second Replies.

    l. Natural religion itself seems to decay [in England] very much. Many
will have human souls to be material; others make God himself a corpo-
real being.
   2. Mr. Locke and his followers are uncertain at least whether the soul is
not material and naturally perishable. 4
   3. Sir Isaac Newton says that space is an organ which God makes use
of to perceive things by. But if God stands in need of any organ to per-
ceive things by, it will follow that they do not depend altogether on him,
nor were produced by him.
   4. Sir Isaac Newton and his followers also have a very odd opinion
concerning the work of God. According to their doctrine, God
Almighty needs to wind up his watch from time to time, 5 otherwise it
would cease to move. He did not, it seems, have sufficient foresight to
make it a perpetual motion. No, the machine of God's making is so
imperfect, according to these gentlemen, that he is obliged to clean it
now and then by an extraordinary concourse, and even to mend it, as a
clockmaker mends his work; he must consequently be so much the
more unskillful a workman as he is more often obliged to mend his
work and to set it right. According to my opinion, the same force6 and
vigor always remains in the world and only passes from one part of
matter to another in agreement with the laws of nature and the beauti-
ful pre-established order. And I hold that when God works miracles, he
does not do it in order to supply the needs of nature, but those of grace.
Whoever thinks otherwise, must necessarily have a very mean notion of
the wisdom and power of God.

Clarke's First Reply7
    l. That there are some in England as well as in other countries who
deny or very much corrupt even natural religion itself is very true and
much to be lamented. But (next to the vicious affections of men) this is to
be principally ascribed to the false philosophy of the materialists, to which
the mathematical principles of philosophy are the most directly repug-
nant. That some make the souls of men, and others even God himself, to
be a corporeal being is also very true, but those who do so are the great
enemies of the mathematical princip les of philosophy; these princip les,
and these alone, prove matter or body to be the smallest and most incon-
siderable part of the universe.
    2. That Mr. Locke doubted whether the soul was immaterial or not
may justly be suspected from some parts of his writings, but in this he has
been followed only by some materialists, enemies of the mathematical
principles of philosophy, who approve little or nothing in Mr. Locke's
writings but his errors.
    3. Sir Isaac Newton does not say that space is the organ which God
makes use of to perceive things by, nor that he has need of any medium at
all by which to perceive things, but on the contrary that he, being omni-
present, perceives all things by his immediate presence to them in all
space, wherever they are, without the intervention or assistance of any
organ or medium whatsoever. In order to make this more intelligible, he
illustrates it by a similitude: that as the mind of man, by its immediate
presence to the pictures or images of things formed in the brain by the
means of the organs of sensation, sees those pictures as if they were the
things themselves, so God sees all things by his immediate presence to
them, given that he is actually present to the things themselves, to all
things in the universe, as the mind of man is present to all the pictures of
things formed in his brain. Sir Isaac Newton considers the brain and
organs of sensation as the means by which those pictures are formed, but
not as the means by which the mind sees or perceives those pictures when
they are so formed. And he does not consider things in the universe as if
they were pictures formed by certain means or organs, but as real things
formed by God himself and seen by him in all places wherever they are,
without the intervention of any medium at all. And this similitude is all
that he means when he supposes infinite space to be (as it were) the senso-
rium of the omnipresent Being.8

  7. November 26, 1715.
  8. Clarke refers to the following passage from Newton's Optics, Q!Jery 28: "ls
not the sensorium of animals the place where the sensitive substance is present,
6                                                                The Correspondence

    4. The reason why, among men, an artificer is justly esteemed so much
the more skillful, as the machine of his composing will continue longer to
move regularly without any further interposition of the workman, is
because the skill of all human artificers consists only in composing, ad just-
ing, or putting together certain movements, the principles of whose motion
are altogether independent of the artificer: such are weights and springs and
the like, whose forces are not made but only adjusted by the workman. But
with regard to God the case is quite different, because he not only composes
or puts things together, but is himself the author and continual preserver of
their original forces or moving powers; and consequently it is not a diminu-
tion, but the true glory of his workmanship, that nothing is done without his
continua( government and inspection. The notion of the world's being a
great machine, going on without the interposition of God as a clock contin-
ues to go without the assistance of a clockmaker, is the notion of materialism
and fate, and tends (under pretence of making God a supramundane inte/li-
gence)9 to exclude providence and God's government in reality out of the
world. And by the same reason that a philosopher can represent all things
going on from the beginning of the creation without any government or
interposition of providence, a skeptic will easily argue still farther back-
wards and suppose that things have from eternity gone on (as they now do)
without any true creation or original author at all, but only what such argu-
ers call all-wise and eternal nature. If a king had a kingdom in which all
things would continually go on without his government or interposition, or
without his attending to and ordering what is done in the kingdom, it would
be to him merely a nominal kingdom, nor would he in reality deserve at all
the title of king or governor. And as those men who claim that in an earthly
government things may go on perfectly well without the king himself order-
ing or disposing of anything may reasonably be suspected that they would
like very well to set the king aside, so whoever contends that the course of
the world can go on without the continual direction of God, the Supreme
Governor, his doctrine does in effect tend to exclude God out of the world.

and to which the sensible species of things are carried by the nerves and brain, that
they may be perceived there, as being present to the sensitive substance? And do
not the phenomena of nature show that there is an incorporeal, living, intelligent,
omnipresent being who, in the infinite space, which is as it were his sensorium (or
place of perception), sees and discerns the very things themselves in the most in-
timate and thorough manner, and comprehends them as entirely and immediately
present within himself-of these things the sensitive and thinking substance that
is in us perceives and views, in its little sensorium, nothing but the images carried
there by the organs of the senses?"

Leibniz's Second Letter, Being an
Answer to Clarke's First Reply 10
    l. It is rightly observed in the paper delivered to the Princess ofWales,
which Her Royal Highness has been pleased to communicate to me, that
next to corruption of manners, the princip les of the materialists do very
much contribute to keep up impiety. But I believe that one has no reason
to add that the mathematical principles of philosophy are opposite to those
of the materialists. On the contrary, they are the same, only with this dif-
ference-that the materialists, in imitation of Democritus, Epicurus, and
Hobbes, confine themselves altogether to mathematical principles and
admit only bodies, whereas the Christian mathematicians also admit
immaterial substances. For this reason, not mathematical principles
(according to the usual sense of that word) but metaphysical princip/es
ought to be opposed to those of the materialists. Pythagoras, Plato, and
Aristotle in some measure had a knowledge of these princip les, but I claim
to have established them demonstratively in my Theodicy, though I have
done it in a popular manner. The great foundation of mathematics is the
princip/e ofcontradiction or identity, that is, that a proposition cannot be true
and false at the same time, and that therefore A is A and cannot be not A.
This single principle is sufficient to demonstrate every part of arithmetic
and geometry, that is, all mathematical principles. But in order to proceed
from mathematics to natural philosophy, another principle is required, as I
have observed in my Theodicy; I mean the princip/e of sufficient reason,
namely, that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so rather
than otherwise. And therefore Archimedes, being desirous to proceed
from mathematics to natural philosophy, in his book De aequilibrio, was
obliged to make use of a particular case of the great princip le of sufficient
reason. He takes it for granted that if there is a balance in which everything
is alike on both sides, 11 and if equal weights are hung on the two ends of
that balance, the whole will be at rest. That is because no reason can be
given why one side should weigh down rather than the other. 12 Now, by
that single princip le, namely, that there ought to be a sufficient reason why
things should be so and not otherwise, one may demonstrate the being of
God and all the other parts of metaphysics or natural theology and even, in
some measure, those princip les of natural philosophy that are independent
of mathematics; I mean the dynamic princip les or the princip les of force. 13

    2. The author proceeds and says that according to the mathematical
princip/es, that is, according to Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy (for mathe-
matical princip/es determine nothing in the present case), matter is the
most inconsiderable part of the universe. The reason is because he admits
empty space besides matter and because, according to his notions, matter
fills up only a very small part of space. But Democritus and Epicurus
maintained the same thing; they differed from Sir Isaac Newton only as
to the quantity of matter, and perhaps they believed there was more mat-
ter in the world than Sir Isaac Newton will allow; in this I think their
opinion ought to be preferred, for the more matter there is, the more God
has occasion to exercise his wisdom and power. This is one reason, among
others, why I maintain that there is no vacuum at all.
    3. I find, in express words in the Appendix to Sir Isaac Newton's
Optics, 14 that space is the sensorium of God. But the word sensorium has
always signified the organ of sensation. He and his friends may now, if
they think fit, explain themselves quite otherwise; I shall not be against it.
    4. The author supposes that the presence of the soul is sufficient to
make it consciously perceive 15 what passes in the brain. But this is the
very thing that Father Malebranche and all the Cartesians deny; and they
rightly deny it. More is required besides bare presence to enable one thing
to represent 16 what passes in another. Some communication that may be
explained, some sort of influence [or things in common or common
cause] 17 is required for this purpose. Space, according to Sir Isaac New-
ton, is intimately present to the body contained in it and commensurate
with it. Does it follow from this that space consciously perceives what

    14. See the footnote to Clarke's First Reply, sec. 3.
  15. Clark's translation has "perceive" for Leibniz's appercevoir. The latter is a
technical term in Leibniz' s philosophy meaning something like "consciously per-
ceive" (which we have chosen to use)-for example, "Monadology," sec. 14, AG
214-5: "The passing state which involves and represents a multitude in the unity
or in the simple substance is nothing other than what one calls perceptwn, which
should be distinguished from apperception, or consciousness, as will be evident in
what follows. This is where the Cartesians have failed badly, since they took no ac-
count of the perceptions that we do not consciously perceive. This is also what
made them believe that minds alone are monads and that there are no animal souls
or other entelechies. With the common people, they have confused a long stupor
with death, proper ly speaking, which made them fall again into the Scholastic prej-
udice of completely separated souls, and they have even confirmed unsound minds
in the belief in the mortality of souls."
    16. Clark's translation has "perceive'' again, though this time it is for Leibniz's
representer.
    17. The bracketed fragment is missing in Clarke's translation.
Leibmz's Second Letter                                                     9

passes in a body and remembers it when that body is gone away? Besides,
the soul being indivisible, its immediate presence, which may be imagined
in the body, would only be in one point. How then could it consciously
perceive what happens out of that point? I claim to be the first who has
shown how the soul consciously perce ives what passes in the body. 18
    5. The reason why God consciously perceives everything is not his
bare presence, but also his operation. It is because he preserves things by
an action that continually produces whatever is good and perfect in them.
But the soul having no immediate influence over the body, 19 nor the body
over the soul, their mutual correspondence cannot be explained by their
being present to each other.
    6. The true and principal reason why we commend a machine is rather
based on the effects of the machine than on its cause. We do not inquire so
much about the power of the artist as we do about his skill in his work-
manship. And therefore the reason advanced by the author for extolling
the machine of God's making, based on his having made it entirely with-
out borrowing any materials from outside-that reason, I say, is not suffi-
cient. It is a mere shift the author has been forced to have recourse to, and
the reason why God exceeds any other artisan is not only because he
makes the whole, whereas all other artisans must have matter to work on.
This excellence in God would be only on the account of power. But God's
excellence also arises from another cause, namely, wisdom, by which his
machine lasts longer and moves more regularly than those of any other
artisan whatsoever. He who buys a watch does not mind whether the
workman made every part of it himself, or whether he got the several
parts made by others and only put them together-provided the watch
goes right. And if the workman had received from God even the gift of
creating the matter of the wheels, yet the buyer of the watch would not be
satisfied, unless the workman had also received the gift of putting them
well together. ln like manner, he who will be pleased with God's work-
manship cannot be so without some other reason than that which the
author has here advanced.
    7. Thus the skill of God must not be inferior to that of a workman; no,
it must go infinitely beyond it. The bare production of everything would
indeed show the power of God, but it would not sufficiently show his wis-
dom. They who maintain the contrary will fall exactly into the error of the
materialists and of Spinoza, from whom they profess to differ. They
would, in such case, acknowledge power but not sufficient wisdom in the
princip le of all things.

10                                                          The Correspondence

    8. I do not say the material world is a machine or watch that goes with-
out God's interposition, and I have sufficiently insisted that the creation
needs to be continually influenced by its creator. But I maintain it to be a
watch that goes without needing to be mended by him; otherwise we must
say that God revises himself. No, God has foreseen everything. He has
provided a remedy for everything beforehand. There is in his works ahar-
mony, a beauty, already pre-established.
    9. This opinion does not exclude God's providence or his government
of the world; on the contrary, it makes it perfect. A true providence of
God requires a perfect foresight. But then it requires, moreover, not only
that he should have foreseen everything, but also that he should have pro-
vid ed for everything beforehand with proper remedies; otherwise, he
must lack either wisdom to foresee things or power to provide for them.
He will be like the God of the Socinians who lives only from day to day, as
Mr. Jurieu says. 20 Indeed, God, according to the Socinians, does not so
much as foresee inconveniences, whereas the gentlemen I am arguing
with, who oblige him to mend his work, say only that he does not provide
against them. But this seems to me to be still a very great imperfection.
According to this doctrine, God must lack either power or good will.
    10. I do not think I can be rightly blamed for saying that God is intelli-
gentia supramundana.21 Will they say that he is intelligentia mundana, that
is, the soul of the world? I hope not. However, they will do well to take
care not to fall into that notion unawares.
    ll. The comparison of a king, under whose reign everything should go
on without his interposition, is by no means to the present purpose, since
God continually preserves everything and nothing can subsist without
him. His kingdom therefore is not a nominal one. It is just as if one
should say that a king who should originally have taken care to have his
subjects so well educated, and should, by his care in providing for their
subsistence, preserve them so well in their fitness for their several stations
and in their good affection toward him, as that he should have no occasion
ever to be amending anything among them, would be only a nominal king.
    12. To conclude. If God is obliged to mend the course of nature from
time to time, it must be done either supernaturally or naturally. If it is
done supernaturally, we must have recourse to miracles in order to explain

 20. This probably refers to Pierre Jurieu's Le tableau du Soc1manisme (The
Hague, 1690). The Socinians were a Protestant sect, forerunners ofUnitarianism,
founded by Laelius and Faustus Socinius. One of the Socinian doctrines was that
God's foreknowledge was limited to what was necessary and did not apply to the
possible.

natural things,22 which is reducing a hypothesis ad absurdum, for every-
thing may easily be accounted for by miracles. But if it is done naturally,
then God will not be intelligentia supramundana; 23 he will be compre-
hended under the nature of things, that is, he will be the soul of the world.

Clarke's Second Reply24
    l. When I said that the mathematical principles of philosophy are
opposite to those of the materialists, the meaning was that, whereas mate-
rialists suppose the frame of nature to be such as could have arisen from
mere mechanical princip les of matter and motion, of necessity and fate,
the mathematical principles of philosophy show on the contrary that the
state of things (the constitution of the sun and planets) is such as could
not arise from anything but an intelligent and free cause. As to the propri-
ety of the name: to the extent that metaphysical consequences follow
demonstratively from mathematical principles, mathematical principles
may (if it is thought fit) be called metaphysical principles.
    It is very true that nothing is without a sufficient reason why it is, and
why it is thus rather than otherwise. And, therefore, where there is no
cause, there can be no effect. But this sufficient reason is often times no
other than the mere will of God. There can be no other reason but the
mere will of God, for instance, why this particular system of matter
should be created in one particular place, and that in another particular
place, when (all place being absolutely indifferent to all matter) it would
have been exactly the same thing vice versa, supposing the two systems
(or the particles) of matter to be alike. And if it could in no case act with-
out a predetermining cause, any more than a balance can move without a
preponderating weight, 25 this would tend to take away all power of choos-
ing and to introduce fatality.
    2. Many ancient Greeks, who had their philosophy from the Phoeni-
cians and whose philosophy was corrupted by Epicurus, held indeed in
general matter and vacuum; but they did not know how to apply those
princip les to the explanation of the phenomena of nature by mathematics.
However small the quantity of matter is, God does not at all have the less
subject to exercise his wisdom and power on it, for other things, as well as
matter, are equally subjects on which God exercises his power and wis-
dom. By the same argument it might just as well have been proved that

men, or any other particular species of beings, must be infinite in number,
lest God should lack subjects on which to exercise his power and wisdom.
    3. The word sensory does not properly signify the organ, but the place
of sensation. The eye, the ear, etc., are organs, but not sensoria. Besides,
Sir Isaac Newton does not say that space is the sensory, but that it is, by
way of similitude only, "as it were the sensory, etc. "26
    4. lt was never supposed that the presence of the soul was sufficient,
but only that it is necessary, in order to have perception. Without being
present to the images of the things perceived, it could not possibly per-
ceive them, but being present is not sufficient without it being also a liv-
ing substance. Any inanimate substance, though present, perceives
nothing. And a living substance can only perceive where it is present
either to the things themselves (as the omnipresent God is to the whole
universe) or to the images of things (as the soul of man is in its proper
sensory). Nothing can any more act or be acted on where it is not present
than it can be where it is not. The soul's being indivisible does not prave it
to be present only in a mere point. Space, finite or infinite, is absolutely
indivisible, even so much as in thought (to imagine its parts moved from
each other is to imagine them moved out of themselves); 27 and yet space
is not a mere point.
    5. God perceives things, not indeed by his simple presence to them,
nor yet by his operation on them, but by his being a living and intelligent,
as well as an omnipresent substance. The soul likewise (within its narrow
sphere), not by its simple presence, but by its being a living substance,
perceives the images to which it is present and which, without being
present to them, it could not perceive.
    6 and 7. lt is very true that the excellence of Gad's workmanship does
not consist in its showing the power only, but in its also showing the wis-
dom of its author. But then this wisdom of God does not appear in making
nature (as an artificer makes a clock) capable of going on without him (for
that is impossible, there being no powers of nature independent of God as
the powers of weights and springs are independent of men), but the wis-
dom of God consists in framing originally the perfect and complete idea of
a work, which began and continues according to that original perfect idea
by the continual uninterrupted exercise of his power and goverrunent.
    8. The word correction or amendment is to be understood, not with

 27. Clarke refers to Newton, Principia, scholium to Definition 8: "As the order
of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of the parts of space. Suppose
these parts to be moved out of their places, and they will be moved (if the expres-
sion may be allowed) out of themselves." See Appendix B, no. l.

regard to God, but only to us. The present frame of the solar system, for
instance, according to the present laws of motion, will in time fall into con-
fusion28 and, perhaps, after that, will be amended or put into a new form.
But this amendment is only relative with regard to our conceptions. In real-
ity, and with regard to God, the present frame, and the consequent disor-
der, and the following renovation, are all equally parts of the design framed
in God's original perfect idea. lt is in the frame of the world, as in the frame
of man' s body; the wisdom of God does not consist in making the present
frame of either of them eternal, but to last so long as he thought fit.
    9. The wisdom and foresight of God do not consist in originally pro-
vid ing remedies that shall of themselves cure the disorders of nature.29
For in truth and strictness, with regard to God there are no disorders, and
consequently no remedies, and indeed no powers of nature at all that can
do anything of themselves30 (as weights and springs work of themselves
with regard to men); but the wisdom and foresight of God consist (as has
been said) in contriving at once what his power and government is contin-
ually putting in actual execution.
    10. God is neither a mundane intelligence, nor a supramundane intelli-
gence,31 but an omnipresent intelligence, both in and outside the world.
He is in all, and through all, as well as above all.
    ll. If God's conserving all things means his actual operation and gov-
ernment in preserving and continuing the beings, powers, orders, disposi-
tions, and motions of all things, this is all that is contended for. But if his
conserving things means no more than a king's creating such subjects as
shall be able to act well enough without his intermeddling or ordering
anything among them ever after, this is making him indeed a real creator,
but only a nominal governor.
    12. The argument in this paragraph supposes that whatever God does
is supernatural or miraculous, and consequently it tends to exclude all
operation of God in the governing and ordering of the natural world. But
the truth is, natural and supernatural are nothing at all different with
regard to God, but merely distinctions in our conceptions of things. To
cause the sun (or earth) to move regularly is something we call natural. To
stop its motion for a day, we call supernatural. But the one is the effect of
no greater power than the other; nor is the one with respect to God more

or less natural or supernatural than the other. God's being present in or to
the world does not make him the soul of the world. 32 A soul is part of a
compound, of which body is the other part, and they mutually affect each
other as parts of the same whole. But God is present to the world, not as a
part, but as a governor, acting on all things, himself acted on by nothing.
He is not far from every one of us, for in him we (and all things) live and
move and have our beings.

    l. According to the usual way of speaking, mathematical princip/es con-
cern only pure mathematics, namely, numbers, figures, arithmetic, geom-
etry. But metaphysical princip/es concern more general notions, such as are
cause and effect.
    2. The author grants me this important principle, that nothing hap-
pens without a sufficient reason why it should be so rather than otherwise.
But he grants it only in words and in reality denies it. This shows that he
does not fully understand its strength. And therefore he makes use of an
instance, which exactly falls in with one of my demonstrations against real
absolute space, the idol of some modern Englishmen. I call it an idol, not
in a theological sense, but in a philosophical one, as Chancellor Bacon says
that there are idola tribus, idola specus. 34
    3. These gentlemen maintain, therefore, that space is a real absolute
being. But this involves them in great difficulties, for it appears that such
a being must necessarily be eternal and infinite. Hence some have believed
it to be God himself, or one of his attributes, his immensity. But since
space consists of parts, it is not a thing that can belong to God.
    4. As for my own opinion, I have said more than once that I hold space
to be something purely relative, as time is-that I hold it to be an order of
coexistences, as time is an order of successions. For space denotes, in
terms of possibility, an order of things that exist at the same time, consid-
ered as existing together, without entering into their particular manners
of existing. And when many things are seen together, one consciously per-
ceives this order of things among themselves.
    5. I have many demonstrations to confute the fancy of those who take

space to be a substance or at least an absolute being. But I shall only use,
at present, one demonstration, which the author here gives me occasion
to insist upon. I say, then, that if space was an absolute being, something
would happen for which it would be impossible that there should be a suf-
ficient reason35-which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus: Space is
something absolutely uniform, and without the things placed in it, one
point of space absolutely does not differ in any respect whatsoever from
another point of space. Now from this it follows (supposing space to be
something in itself, besides the order of bodies among themselves) that it
is impossible there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situ-
ations of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space
after one certain particular manner and not otherwise-why everything
was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing east into
west. But if space is nothing else but this order or relation, and is nothing
at all without bodies but the possibility of placing them, then those two
states, the one such as it is now, the other supposed to be the quite con-
trary way, would not at all differ from one another. Their difference there-
fore is only to be found in our chimerical supposition of the reality of
space in itself. But in truth the one would exactly be the same thing as the
other, they being absolutely indiscernible, and consequently there is no
room to inquire after a reason for the preference of the one to the other.
    6. The case is the same with respect to time. Supposing anyone should
ask why God did not create everything a year sooner, and the same person
should infer from this that God has done something concerning which it
is not possible that there should be a reason why he did it so and not oth-
erwise; the answer is that his inference would be right, if time was any-
thing distinct from things existing in time. For it would be impossible that
there should be any reason why things should be applied to such particu-
lar instants rather than to others, their succession continuing the same.
But then the same argument proves that instants, considered without the
things, are nothing at all and that they consist only in the successive order
of things; this order remaining the same, one of the two states, namely,
that of a supposed anticipation, would not at all differ, nor could be dis-
cerned from the other which now is.
    7. lt appears from what I have said that my axiom has not been well
understood and that the author denies it, though he seems to grant it. lt is
true, he says, that there is nothing without a sufficient reason why it is,
and why it is thus rather than otherwise, but he adds that this sufficient
reason is often the simple or mere will of God-as when it is asked why
matter was not placed elsewhere in space, the same situations of bodies

among themselves being preserved. But this is plainly to maintain that
God wills something without any sufficient reason for his will, against the
axiom or the general rule of whatever happens. This is falling back into
the loose indifference, which I have amply refuted and shown to be abso-
lutely chimerical even in creatures and contrary to the wisdom of God, as
if he could operate without acting by reason.
    8. The author objects against me that, if we do not admit this simple
and pure will, we take away from God the power of choosing and bring in
a fatality. But quite the contrary is true. I maintain that God has the
power of choosing, since I ground that power on the reason of a choice
agreeable to his wisdom. And it is not this fatality (which is only the wis-
est order of providence) but a blind fatality or necessity void of all wisdom
and choice, which we ought to avoid.
    9. I had observed that by lessening the quantity of matter, the quantity
of objects on which God may exercise his goodness will be lessened. The
author answers that instead of matter, there are other things in the void
space on which God may exercise his goodness. That may be so, though I
do not grant it, for I hold that every created substance is attended with
matter. However, let it be so. I answer that more matter was consistent
with those same things, and consequently the said objects will be stillless-
ened. The instance of a greater number of men or animals is not to the
purpose, for they would fill up place in exclusion of other things.
    10. It will be difficult to make me believe that sensorium does not, in its
usual meaning, signify an organ of sensation. See the words of Rudolphus
Goclenius in his Dictionarium Philosophicum under Sensiterium. "Bar-
barum Scholasticorum," says he, "qui interdum sunt simiae Graecorum.
Hi dicunt aitheterwn, ex quo illi fecerunt Sensiterium pro Sensorio, id est,
Organa Sensationis. " 36
    ll. The mere presence of a substance, even an animated one, is not
sufficient for perception. A blind man, and even a man whose thoughts
are wandering, does not see. The author must explain how the soul con-
sciously perceives what is outside itsel(
    12. God is not present to things by situation but by essence; his pres-
ence is manifested by his immediate operation. The presence of the soul is

Hildesheim: Georg O lrns, 1980), p. 1024. Goclenius was a standard reference work
for seventeenth-century school philosophers, an alphabetical compendium of
standard definitions and distinctions. The passage translates as: "[Sensiterium is]
a barbarism due to the scholastics, who sometimes aped the Greeks. The Greeks
said aitheterion, from which the scholastics made up sensiterium, in place of senso-
num, that is, the organ of sensation."

of quite another nature. To say that it is diffused all over the body is to
make it extended and divisible. To say it is, the whole of it, in every part of
the body is to make it divisible of itself. 37 To fix it to a point, to diffuse it
all over many points, are only abusive expressions, idola tribus. 38
    13. If active force should diminish in the universe by the natural laws
which God has established, so that there should be need for him to give a
new impression in order to restore that force, like an artisan's mending
the imperfections of his machine, the disorder would not only be with
respect to us, but also with respect to God himself. He might have pre-
vented it and taken better measures to avoid such an inconvenience, and
therefore, indeed, he has actually done it.
    14. When I said that God has provided remedies beforehand against
such disorders, I did not say that God allows disorders to happen and
then finds remedies for them, but that he has found a way beforehand to
prevent any disorders happening.
    15. The author strives in vain to criticize my expression that God is
intel/igentia supramundana. 39 To say that God is above the world is not
denying that he is in the world.
    16. I never gave any occasion to doubt but that God's conservation is
an actual preservation and continuation of the beings, powers, orders, dis-
positions, and motions of all things, and I think I have perhaps explained
it better than many others. But, says the author, "this is all that I con-
tended for." To this I answer, "your humble servant for that, Sir." Our
dispute consists in many other things. The question is whether God does
not act in the most regular and most perfect manner; whether his machine
is liable to disorders, which he is obliged to m end by extraordinary means;
whether the will of God can act without reason; whether space is an abso-
lute being; also in what consists the nature of miracles; and many such
things, which make a wide difference between us.
    17. Theologians will not grant the author's position against me,
namely, that there is no difference, with respect to God, between natural
and supernatural; and it will be still less approved by most philosophers.
There is a vast difference between these two things, but it plainly appears
that it has not been duly considered. That which is supernatural exceeds
all the powers of creatures. I shall give an instance which I have often
made use of with good success. If God wanted to cause a body to move
free in the ether around about a certain fixed center, without any other
creature acting on it, I say it could not be done without a miracle, since it

cannot be explained by the nature of bodies. For a free body does natu-
rally recede from a curve in the tangent. And therefore I maintain that the
attraction of bodies, properly called, is a miraculous thing,40 since it can-
not be explained by the nature of bodies.


Clarke's Third Reply41
     l. This relates only to the signification of words. The definitions here
given may well be allowed, and yet mathematical reasonings may be
applied to physical and metaphysical subjects.
    2. Undoubtedly nothing is without a sufficient reason why it is rather
than not, and why it is thus rather than otherwise. But in things indiffer-
ent in their own nature, mere will, without anything external to influence
it, is alone that sufficient reason-as in the instance of God's creating or
placing any particle of matter in one place rather than in another, when all
places are originally alike. And the case is the same, even though space was
nothing real but only the mere order of bodies; for still it would be abso-
lutely indifferent, and there could be no other reason but mere will why
three equal particles should be placed or ranged in the order a, b, e, rather
than in the contrary order. And therefore no argument can be drawn from
this indifference of all places to prove that no space is real. For different
spaces are really different or distinct one from another, though they are
perfectly alike. And there is this evident absurdity in supposing space not
to be real but to be merely the order of bodies, that, according to that
notion, if the earth and sun and moon had been placed where the most
remote fixed stars are now (provided they were placed in the same order
and distance they are now with regard one to another) it would not only
have been (as this learned author rightly says) la meme chose, the same
thing in effect-which is very true-but it would also follow that they
would then have been in the same place too, as they are now-which is an
express contradiction.
    The ancients did not call all space void of bodies, but only extramun-
dane space, by the name of imaginary space.42 The meaning of this is not
that such space is not real, 43 but only that we are wholly ignorant what

 42. Clarke states: "This was occasioned by a passage in the private letter with
which Mr. Leibniz's third paper came enclosed." Previous editors of Leibniz's
works did not find any such letter among Leibniz' s papers.
  43. Clarke adds, "Of nothing there are no dimensions, no magnitudes, no quan-
tity, no properties."
Clarke 's Third Reply                                                     19

kinds of things are in that space. Those writers who, by the word imagi-
nary, meant at any time to affirm that space was not real did not thereby
prove that it was not real.
    3. Space is not a being, an eternal and infinite being, but a property or
a consequence of the existence of an infinite and eternal being.44 Infinite
space is immensity, but immensity is not God; and therefore infinite
space is not God. Nor is there any difficulty in what is here advanced
about space having parts. For infinite space is one, absolutely and essen-
tially indivisible, and to suppose it parted is a contradiction in terms,
because there must be space in the partition itself, which is to suppose it
parted and yet not parted at the same time. 45 The immensity or omni-
presence of God is no more a dividing of his substance into parts than his
duration or continuance of existing is a dividing of his existence into
parts. There is no difficulty here but what arises from the figurative abuse
of the word parts.
    4. If space was nothing but the order of things coexisting, it would fol-
low that if God should remove in a straight line the whole entire material
world, with any speed whatsoever, it would still always continue in the
same place, and that nothing would receive any shock upon the most sud-
den stopping of that motion. And if time was nothing but the order of
succession of created things, it would follow that if God had created the
world millions of ages sooner than he did, it would not have been created
at all the sooner. Further, space and time are quantities, which situation
and order are not.
    5. The argument in this paragraph is that, because space is uniform or
alike, and one part does not differ from another, therefore the bodies cre-
ated in one place, if they had been created in another place (supposing
them to keep the same situation with regard to each other), would still
have been created in the same place as before-which is a manifest con-
tradiction. The uniformity of space does indeed prove that there could be
no (external) reason why God should create things in one place rather
than in another, but does that hinder his own will from being to itself a
sufficient reason of acting in any place, when all places are indifferent or
alike and there is good reason to act in some p lace?
    6. The same reasoning takes place here as in the foregoing.
    7 and 8. Where there is any difference in the nature of things, there the
consideration of that difference always determines an intelligent and per-
fectly wise agent. But when two ways of acting are equally and alike good
(as in the instances previously mentioned), to affirm in such case that God

cannot act at all, 46 or that it is no perfection in him to be able to act,
because he can have no external reason to move him to act one way rather
than the other, seems to be a denying God to have in himself any original
principle or power of beginning to act, but that he must necessarily be (as
it were mechanically) always determined by extrinsic things.
   9. I suppose that determinate quantity of matter now in the world is
the most convenient for the present frame of nature, or the present state
of things, and that a greater (as well as a lesser) quantity of matter would
have made the present frame of the world less convenient and conse-
quently would not have been a greater object for God to have exercised
his goodness upon.
    10. The question is not what Goclenius, but what Sir Isaac Newton
means by the word sensorium, when the debate is about Sir Isaac New-
ton's sense,47 and not about the sense of Goclenius' book. If Goclenius
takes the eye or ear or any other organ of sensation to be the sensorium,
he is certainly mistaken. But when any writer expressly explains what he
means by any term of art, of what use is it in this case to inquire in what
different senses perhaps some other writers have sometimes used the
same word? Scapula explains it by domicilium, the place where the mind
resides. 48
    ll. The soul of a blind man does not see for this reason, because no
images are conveyed to the sensorium where the soul is present (there
being some obstruction in the way). How the soul of a seeing man sees the
images to which it is present, we do not know, but we are sure it cannot
consciously perceive what it is not present to, because nothing can act or
be acted on where it is not.
    12. God, being omnipresent, is really present to everything essentially
and substantially.49 His presence manifests indeed itselfby its operation,
but it could not operate if it was not there. The soul is not omnipresent to
every part of the body and therefore does not and cannot itself actually
operate on every part of the body, but only on the brain or certain nerves
and spirits, which, by laws and communications of God's appointing,
influence the whole body.

    13 and 14. The active forces, 50 which are in the universe diminishing
themselves so as to stand in need of new impressions, is no inconvenience,
no disorder, no im perfection in the workmanship of the universe, but is
the consequence of the nature of dependent things. This dependency of
things is not a matter that needs to be rectified. The case of a human
workman making a machine is quite another thing, because the powers or
forces by which the machine continues to move are altogether indepen-
dent of the artificer.
    15. The phrase intelligentia supramundana may well be allowed, as it is
here explained, but without this explication, the expression is very apt to
lead to a wrong notion, as if God was not really and substantially present
everywhere.
    16. To the questions proposed here the answer is: that God does always
act in the most regular and perfect manner, that there are no disorders in
the workmanship of God, and that there is nothing more extraordinary in
the alterations he is pleased to make in the frame of things than in his
continuation of it; that in things absolutely equal and indifferent in their
own nature, the will of God can freely choose and determine itself, with-
out any external cause to impel it, and that it is a perfection in God to be
able so to do; that space does not at all depend on the order or situation or
existence of bodies.
    17. And as to the notion of miracles, the question is not what it is that
theologians or philosophers usually allow or do not allow, but what rea-
sons men advance for their opinions. If a miracle is only that which sur-
passes the power of all created beings, then for a man to walk on the water,
or for the motion of the sun or the earth to be stopped, is no miracle, since
none of these things require infinite power to effect them. For a body to
move in a circle around a center in vacuo if it is usual (as the planets mov-
ing about the sun), it is no miracle, whether it is effected immediately by
God himself or mediately by any created power; but if it is unusual (as for
a heavy body to be suspended and move so in the air), it is equally a mira-
de, whether it is effected immediately by God himself or mediately by any

 50. Clarke notes that "The word active force signifies here nothing but motion
and the impetus or relative impulsive force of bodies arising from and being pro-
portional to their motion. For, the occasion of what has passed upon this head was
the following passage." He then quotes from Newton's Optics, Query 31: "it ap-
pears that motion may be gotten or lost. But by reason of the tenacity of fluids and
attrition of their parts and the weakness of elasticity in solids, motion is much more
apt to be lost than gotten, and is always upon the decay. ... Seeing therefore the
variety of motion which we find in the world is always decreasing, there is a neces-

invisible created power. Lastly, if whatever does not arise from, and is not
explicable by the natural powers of body is a miracle, then every animal
motion whatsoever is a miracle. This seems demonstrably to show that
this leamed author's notion of a miracle is erroneous.

    l. In absolutely indifferent things there is [no foundation for] choice,52
and consequently no election or will, since choice must be founded on
some reason or principle.
    2. A simple will without any motive53 is a fiction, not only contrary to
God's perfection, but also chimerical and contradictory, inconsistent with
the definition of the will, and sufficiently refuted in my Theodicy.
    3. It is an indifferent thing to place three bodies, equal and perfectly
alike, in any order whatsoever, and consequently they will never be placed
in any order by him who does nothing without wisdom. 54 But then, he
being the author of things, no such things will be pro duced by him at all,
and consequently there are no such things in nature.
    4. There is no such thing as two individuals indiscernible from each
other. An ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance, discoursing with me
in the presence of Her Electoral Highness, the Princess Sophia, in the
garden of Herrenhausen, 55 thought he could find two leaves perfectly
alike. The princess defied him to do it, and he ran all over the garden a
long time to look for some; but it was to no purpose. Two drops of water
or milk, viewed with a microscope, will appear distinguishable from each
other. This is an argument against atoms, which are confuted, as well as a
vacuum, by the principles of true metaphysics.
    5. Those great principles of sufficient reason and of the identity ofindis-
cernib/es change the state of metaphysics. That science becomes real and
demonstrative by means of these princip les, whereas before it did gener-
ally consist in empty words.
    6. To suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing
under two names. And therefore to suppose that the universe could have

had at first another position of time and place than that which it actually
had, and yet that all the parts of the universe should have had the same
situation among themselves as that which they actually had, such a sup-
position, I say, is an impossible fiction.
    7. The same reason which shows that extramundane space is imaginary
proves that all empty space is an imaginary thing, for they differ only as
greater and less.
    8. If space is a property or attribute, it must be the property of some
substance. But what substance will that bounded empty space be an affec-
tion or property of, which the persons I am arguing with suppose to be
between two bodies?
    9. If infinite space is immensity, finite space will be the opposite to
immensity, that is, it will be mensurability, or limited extension. Now
extension must be the affection of something extended. But if that space
is empty, it will be an attribute without a subject, an extension without
anything extended. Thus, by making space a property, the author falls in
with my opinion, which makes it an order of things and not anything
absolute.
    10. If space is an absolute reality, far from being a property or an acci-
dent opposed to substance, it will have a greater reality than substances
themselves. God cannot destroy it, nor even change it in any respect. It will
be not only immense in the whole but also immutable and eternal in every
part. There will be an infinite number of eternal things besides God.
    ll. To say that infinite space has no parts is to say that it does not con-
sist of finite spaces and that infinite space might subsist though all finite
space should be reduced to nothing. lt would be as if one should say, in
accordance with the Cartesian supposition of a material extended unlim-
ited world, that such a world might subsist, though all the bodies of which
it consists should be reduced to nothing.
    12. The author attributes parts to space, on p. 19 of the third edition of
his Defense ofthe Argument against Mr. Dodwe/ll 56 and makes them insepa-
rable one from another. But, on p. 30 of his Second Defense, he says they
are parts "improperly so called," which may be understood in a good
sense.
    13. To say that God can cause the whole universe to move forward in a
right line or in any other line, without making otherwise any alteration in
it, is another chimerical supposition. 57 For two states indiscernible from
each other are the same state, and consequently, it is a change without any
change. Besides, there is neither rhyme nor reason in it. But God does

nothing without reason, and it is impossible that there should be any here.
Besides, it would be agendo nihil agere, 58 as I have just now said, because of
the indiscemibility.
    14. These are idola tribus 59 mere chimeras, and superficial imagina-
tions. All this is only grounded on the supposition that imaginary space is
real.
    15. lt is a like fiction, (that is) an impossible one, to suppose that God
might have created the world some millions of years sooner. They who
run into such kind of fictions can give no answer to those who would
argue for the eternity of the world. For since God does nothing without
reason, and no reason can be given why he did not create the world
sooner, it will follow either that he has created nothing at all, or that he
created the world before any assignable time, that is, that the world is eter-
nal. But when once it has been shown that the beginning, whenever it was,
is always the same thing, the question why it was not otherwise ordered
becomes needless and insignificant.
    16. If space and time were anything absolute, that is, if they were any-
thing else besides certain orders of things, then indeed my assertion
would be a contradiction. But since it is not so, the hypothesis [that space
and time are anything absolute]60 is contradictory, that is, it is an impossi-
ble fiction.
    17. And the case is the same as in geometry, where by the very supposi-
tion that a figure is greater than it really is, we sometimes prove that it is
not greater. This indeed is a contradiction, but it lies in the hypothesis,
which appears to be false for that very reason.
    18. Space being uniform, there can be neither any external nor internal
reason by which to distinguish its parts and to make any choice among
them. For any external reason to discern between them can only be
grounded on some internal one. Otherwise we should discern what is
indiscemible or choose without disceming. A will without reason would
be the chance of the Epicureans. A God who should act by such a will
would be a God only in name. The cause of these errors proceeds from
lack of care to avoid what derogates from the divine perfections.
    19. When two incompatible things are equally good, and neither one of
them has any advantage over the other, in themselves or by their com bina-
tion with other things, God will produce neither of them.61

    20. God is never determined by external things but always by what is
in himself, that is, by his knowledge of things before anything exists out-
side himself.
    21. There is no possible reason that can limit the quantity of matter,
and therefore such limitation can have no place.
    22. And supposing this arbitrary limitation of the quantity of matter,
something might always be added to it without derogating from the per-
fection of those things which do already exist, and consequently some-
thing must always be added in order to act according to the principle of
the perfection of the divine operations.
    23. And therefore it cannot be said that the present quantity of matter
is the fittest for the present constitution of things. And supposing it was,
it would follow that this present constitution of things would not be the
fittest absolutely, if it binders God from using more matter. lt is therefore
better to choose another constitution of things, capable of something
more.
    24. I should be glad to see a passage of any philosopher who takes sen-
sorium in any other sense than Goclenius does. [l was right in quoting the
Philosophical Dictionary of this author to show the usual sense in which
                                                                t
the word sensorium is taken; this is what dictionaries are for. 2
    25. If Scapula says that sensorium is the place in which the understand-
ing resides, he means by it the organ of internal sensation. And therefore
he does not differ from Goclenius.
    26. Sensorium has always signified the organ of sensation. The pineal
gland would be, according to Descartes, the sensorium in the above men-
tioned sense of Scapula.
    27. There is hardly any less appropriate expression on this subject than
that which gives God a sensorium. lt seems to make God the soul of the
world. And it will be a hard matter to put a justifiable sense on this word,
according to the use Sir Isaac Newton makes of it.
    28. Though the question is about the sense put on that word by Sir
Isaac Newton, and not by Goclenius, yet I am not to blame for quoting
the Philosophical Dictionary of that author, because the design of dictio-
naries is to show the use of words.
    29. God consciously perceives things in himself. Space is the place of
things and not the place of God's ideas, unless we look upon space as
something that makes a union between God and things in imitation of the
imagined union between the soul and the body, which would still make
God the soul of the world.

tition in sec. 28).

    30. And indeed, the author is much in the wrong when he compares
God's knowledge and operation with the knowledge and operation of
souls. The soul knows things because God has put into it a principle rep-
resentative of outside things. 63 But God knows things because he pro-
duces them continually.
    31 . The soul does not act on things, according to my opinion, in any
way other than because the body adapts itself to the desires of the soul, by
virtue of the harmony which God has pre-established between them. 64
    32. But they who fancy that the soul can give a new force to the body,
and that God does the same in the world in order to mend the imperfec-
tions of his machine, make God too much like the soul by ascribing too
much to the soul and too little to God.
    33. For none but God can give a new force to nature, and he does it
only supernaturally. If there was need for him to do it in the natural
course of things, he would have made a very im perfect work. At that rate,
he would be with respect to the world what the soul, in the vulgar notion,
is with respect to the body.
    34. Those who undertake to defend the vulgar opinion concerning the
soul's influence over the body by instancing God's operating on external
things, make God still too much like a soul of the world. To which I add
that the author's affecting to find fault with the words intelligentia supra-
mundana seems also to incline that way.
    35. The images with which the soul is immediately affected are within
itself, but they correspond to those of the body. The presence of the soul
is imperfect and can only be explained by that correspondence. But the
presence of God is perfect and manifested by his operation.
    36. The author wrongly supposes against me that the presence of the
soul is connected with its influence over the body, for he knows I reject
that influence.
    37. The soul's being diffused through the brain is no less inexplicable
than its being diffused through the whole body. The difference is only in
more and less.
    38. They who fancy that active forces decrease of themselves in the
world do not well understand the principallaws of nature and the beauty
of the works of God. 65

the dependence of things?

    40. The imperfection of our machines, which is the reason why they
need to be mended, proceeds from this very thing, that they do not suffi-
ciently depend upon the workman. And therefore the dependence of
nature on God, far from being the cause of such an im perfection, is rather
the reason why there is no such imperfection in nature, because nature is
so dependent on an artist who is too perfect to make a work that needs to
be mended. lt is true that every particular machine of nature is in some
measure liable to be disordered, but not the whole universe, which cannot
diminish in perfection.
    41. The author contends that space does not depend on the situation of
bodies. I answer: lt is true, it does not depend on such or such a situation
of bodies, but it is that order which renders bodies capable of being situ-
ated, and by which they have a situation among themselves when they
exist together, as time is that order with respect to their successive posi-
tion. But if there were no creatures, space and time would be only in the
ideas of God.
    42. The author seems to acknowledge here that his notion of a miracle
is not the same as that which theologians and philosophers usually have. It
is therefore sufficient for my purpose that my adversaries are obliged to
have recourse to what is commonly called a miracle (which one attempts
to avoid in philosophy).
    43. I am afraid the author, by altering the sense commonly put on the
word miracle, will fall into an inconvenient opinion. The nature of a mira-
de does not at all consist in usualness or unusualness, for then monsters
would be miracles.
    44. There are miracles of an inferior sort which an angel can work. He
can, for instance, make a man walk upon the water without sinking. But
there are miracles which none but God can work, they exceeding all natu-
ral powers. Of this kind are creating and annihilating.
    45. lt is also a supernatural thing that bodies should attract one
another at a distance without any intermediate means and that a body
should move around without receding in the tangent, though nothing
binders it from so receding. For these effects cannot be explained by the
nature of things.
    46. Why should it be impossible to explain the motion of animals by
natural forces? Though, indeed, the beginning of animals is no less inex-
plicable by natural forces than the beginning of the world.

notion of a vacuum and atoms, but reason brought me into the right
way. It was a pleasing imagination. Men carry their inquiries no further
than those two things: they (as it were) nail down their thoughts to
them; they fancy they have found out the first elements of things, a non
plus ultra. We would have nature go no further, and be finite as our
minds are; but this is being ignorant of the greatness and majesty of the
author of things. The least corpuscle is actually subdivided to infinity
and contains a world of other creatures that would be lacking in the uni-
verse, if that corpuscle was an atom, that is, a body of one entire piece
without subdivision. ln like manner, to admit a vacuum in nature is
ascribing to God a very imperfect work; it is violating the great princi-
ple of the necessity of a sufficient reason, which many have talked of
without understanding its true force; as I have lately shown in proving,
by that principle, that space is only an order of things, as time also is,
and not at all an absolute being. To omit many other arguments against a
vacuum and atoms, I shall here mention those which I ground on God's
perfection and on the necessity of a sufficient reason. I lay it down as a
principle that every perfection which God could impart to things,67
without derogating from their other perfections, has actually been
imparted to them. Now let us fancy a wholly empty space. God could
have placed some matter in it without derogating in any respect from all
other things; therefore he has actually placed some matter in that space;
therefore, there is no space wholly empty; therefore all is full. The same
argument proves that there is no corpuscle but what is subdivided. I
shall add another argument grounded on the necessity of a sufficient
reason. It is impossible that there should be any principle to determine
what proportion of matter there ought to be, out of all the possible
degrees from a plenum to a vacuum, or from a vacuum to a plenum.
Perhaps it will be said that the one should be equal to the other, but,
because matter is more perfect than a vacuum, reason requires that a
geometrical proportion should be observed and that there should be as
much more matter than vacuum, 68 as the former deserves to be pre-
ferred. But then, there must be no vacuum at all, for the perfection of
matter is to that of a vacuum as something to nothing. And the case is
the same with atoms: what reason can anyone assign for confining
nature in the progression of subdivision? These are fictions, merely
arbitrary and unworthy of true philosophy. The reasons advanced for a
vacuum are mere sophisms.

Clarke's Fourth Reply69
    l and 2. This notion leads to universal necessity and fate, by supposing
that motives have the same relation to the will of an intelligent agent as
weights have to a balance, 70 so that, of two things absolutely indifferent,
an intelligent agent can no more choose either than a balance can move
itself when the weights on both sides are equal.71 But the difference lies
here. A balance is no agent but is merely passive and acted on by the
weights, so that, when the weights are equal, there is nothing to move it.
But intelligent beings are agents-not passive, in being moved by motives
as a balance is by weights-but they have active powers and do move
themselves, sometimes on the view of strong motives, sometimes on weak
ones, and sometimes where things are absolutely indifferent. ln this latter
case, there may be very good reason to act, though two or more ways of
acting may be absolutely indifferent. This learned writer always supposes
the contrary as a princip le, but gives no proof of it, either from the nature
of things or the perfections of God.
    3 and 4. This argument, if it was true, would prove that God neither
has created nor can possibly create any matter at all.72 For the perfectly
solid parts of all matter, if you take them of equal figure and dimensions
(which is always possible in supposition), are exactly alike, and therefore it
would be perfectly indifferent if they were transposed in place; and con-
sequently it was impossible (according to this learned author's argument)
for God to place them in those places in which he did actually place them
at the creation, because he might as easily have transposed their situation.
It is very true that no two leaves, and perhaps no two drops of water, are
exactly alike, because they are very much compounded bodies. But the
case is very different in the parts of simple solid matter. And even in com-
pounds, there is no impossibility for God to make two drops of water
exactly atike. And if he should make them exactly al ike, yet they would
never the more become one and the same drop of water because they were
alike. Nor would the place of the one be the place of the other, though it
was absolutely indifferent which was placed in which place. The same
reasoning holds likewise concerning the original determination of motion,
this way or the contrary way.
    5 and 6. Two things by being exactly alike do not cease to be two. The
parts of time are as exactly alike to each other as those of space, yet two

points of time are not the same point of time, nor are they two names of
only the same point of time. Had God created the world only at this
moment, it would not have been created at the time it was created. And if
God has made (or can make) matter finite in dimensions, the material uni-
verse must consequently be in its nature movable, for nothing that is finite
is immovable. To say therefore that God could not have altered the time or
place of the existence of matter is making matter necessarily infinite and
eternal and reducing all things to necessity and fate.
    7. Extramundane space (if the material world is fi nite in its dimensions)
is not imaginary but real. Nor are void spaces in the world merely imagi-
nary. In an exhausted receiver,73 though rays of light, and perhaps some
other matter, are there in an exceeding small quantity, still the lack of resis-
tance plainly shows that the greatest part of that space is void of matter. For
subtleness or fineness of matter cannot be the cause of lack of resistance.
Quicksilver is as subtle and consists of as fine parts and as fluid as water,
and yet makes more than ten times the resistance; this resistance arises
therefore from the quantity and not from the grossness of the matter.
    8. Space void of body is the property of an incorporeal substance. Space
is not bounded by bodies but exists equally inside and outside bodies.
Space is not enclosed between bodies, but bodies existing in unbounded
space are themselves only terminated by their own dimensions.
    9. Void space is not an attribute without a subject, because by void
space we never mean space void of everything, but void of body only. In
all void space God is certainly present, and possibly so are many other
substances which are not matter, being neither tangible nor objects of any
of our senses.
    10. Space is not a substance but a property, and if it is a property of
that which is necessary, it will consequently (as all other properties of
that which is necessary must do) exist more necessarily (though it is not
itself a substance) than those substances themselves which are not neces-
sary. Space is immense and immutable and eternal, and so also is dura-
tion. Yet it does not at all follow from this that anything is eternal hors de
Dieu. 74 For space and duration are not hors de Dieu, but are caused by
and are immediate and necessary consequences of his existence. 75 And

without them his eternity and ubiquity (or omnipresence) would be
taken away.
    ll and 12. lnfinites are composed of finites in no other sense than as
finites are composed of infinitesimals. ln what sense space has or does not
have parts has been explained before (Third Reply, sec. 3). Parts in the
corporeal sense of the word are separable, compounded, ununited, inde-
pendent of, and movable from each other; but infinite space, though it
may be partially apprehended by us, that is, may in our imagination be
conceived as composed of parts, yet since those parts (improperly so
called) are essentially indiscernible and immovable from each other and
not able to be parted without an express contradiction in terms (see
above, Second Reply, sec. 4 and Third Reply, sec. 3), space consequently is
in itself essentially one and absolutely indivisible.
    13. If the world is finite in dimensions, it is movable by the power of
God and therefore my argument drawn from that movableness is conclu-
sive. Two places, though exactly alike, are not the same place. Nor is the
motion or rest of the universe the same state, 76 any more than the motion
or rest of a ship is the same state, because a man shut up in the cabin can-
not perceive whether the ship sails or not, as long as it moves uniformly.
The motion of the ship, though the man does not perceive it, is a real dif-
ferent state and has real different effects, and, on a sudden stop, it would
have other real effects-and so likewise would an indiscernible motion of
the universe. To this argument no answer has ever been given. lt is largely
insisted on by Sir Isaac Newton in his Mathematical Princip/es (definition
8) where, from the consideration of the properties, causes, and effects of
motion, he shows the difference between real motion, or a body's being
carried from one part of space to another, and relative motion, which is
merely a change of the order or situation of bodies with respect to each
other. This argument is a mathematical one, showing from real effects that
there may be real motion where there is none relative, and relative motion
where there is none real; it is not to be answered by barely asserting the
contrary.
    14. The reality of space is not a supposition, but is proved by the fore-
going arguments to which no answer has been given. Nor is any answer
given to that other argument, that space and time are quantities, which
situation and order are not.
    15. lt was no impossibility for God to make the world sooner or later
than he did, nor is it at all impossible for him to destroy it sooner or later
than it shall actually be destroyed. As to the notion of the world's eter-
nity, they who suppose matter and space to be the same must indeed

suppose the world to be not only infinite and eternal, but necessarily so,
even as necessarily as space and duration, which do not depend on the
will but on the existence of God.77 But they who believe that God cre-
ated matter in what quantity, and at what particular time, and in what
particular spaces he pleased are here under no difficulty. For the wisdom
of God may have very good reasons for creating this world at that partic-
ular time he did, and may have made other kinds of things before this
material world began, and may make other kinds of things after this
world is destroyed.
    16 and 17. That space and time are not the mere order of things but
real quantities (which order and situation are not ) has been proved
above (See Third Reply, sec. 4, and in this paper, sec. 13), and no answer
yet given to those proofs. And until an answer is given to those proofs,
this learned author's assertion is (by his own confession in this place) a
contradiction.
    18. The uniformity of all the parts of space is no argument against
God's acting in any part, after what manner he pleases. God may have
good reasons to create finite beings, and finite beings can only be in par-
ticular places. And, all places being originally alike (even though place is
nothing else but the situation of bodies), God's placing one cube of matter
behind another equal cube of matter, rather than the other behind that, is
a choice no way unworthy of the perfections of God, though both these
situations are perfectly equal, because there may be very good reasons
why both the cubes should exist, and they cannot exist but in one or other
of equally reasonable situations. The Epicurean chance is not a choice of
will but a blind necessity of fate.
    19. This argument (as I now observed, sec. 3), if it proves anything,
proves that God neither did nor can create any matter at all,78 because the
situation of equal and similar parts of matter could not but be originally
indifferent, as was also the original determination of their motions this
way or the contrary way.
    20. I do not understand what this tends to prove with regard to the
argument before us.
    21. That God cannot limit the quantity of matter is an assertion of too
great consequence to be admitted without proof. If he cannot limit the
duration of it neither, then the material world is both infinite and eternal
necessarily and independently of God.
    22 and 23. This argument, if it is good, would prove that whatever God
can do he cannot but do, and consequently that he cannot but make every-

thing infinite and everything etemal. This is making him no governor at
all but a mere necessary agent, that is, indeed, no agent at all but mere fate
and nature and necessity.
    24---28. Concerning the use of the word sensory (though Sir Isaac New-
ton says only "as it were the sensory"), enough has been said in my Third
Reply, sec. 10, Second Reply, sec. 3, and First Reply, sec. 3.
    29. Space is the place of all things and of all ideas, just as duration is
the duration of all things and of all ideas. That this has no tendency to
make God the soul of the world, see above, Second Reply, sec. 12. There is
no union between God and the world. The mind of man might with
greater propriety be called the soul of the images of things it perceives
than God can be called the soul of the world, to which he is present
throughout and acts on it as he pleases, without being acted on by it.
Though this answer was given before (Second Reply, sec. 12), yet the
same objection is repeated again and again, without taking any notice of
the answer.
    30. I do not understand what is meant by representative principle.19 The
soul discerns things by having the images of things conveyed to it through
the organs of sense; God discerns things by being present to and in the
substances of the things themselves--not by producing them continually
(for he rests now from his work of creation), but by being continually
omnipresent to everything he created at the beginning.
    31. That the soul should not operate on the body,80 and yet the body by
mere mechanical impulse of matter conform itself to the will of the soul in
all the infinite variety of spontaneous animal motion, is a perpetual mira-
de. Pre-established harmony is a mere word or term of art and does noth-
ing toward explaining the cause of so miraculous an effect.
    32. To suppose that in spontaneous animal motion the soul gives no
new motion or impression to matter, but that all spontaneous animal
motion is performed by mechanical impulse of matter, is reducing all
things to mere fate and necessity. God's acting in the world on everything
after what manner he pleases, without any union and without being acted
on by anything, shows plainly the difference between an omnipresent gov-
ernor and an imaginary soul of the world.
    33. Every action is (in the nature of things) the giving of a new force to
the thing acted on. Otherwise it is not really action but mere passiveness,
as in the case of all mechanical and inanimate communications of motion.
If therefore the giving a new force is supernatural, then every action of
God is supernatural and he is quite excluded from the government of the

natural world, and every action of man is either supernatural, or else man
is as mere a machine as a clock.
    34 and 35. The difference between the true notion of God and that of a
soul of the world has been before shown: Second Reply sec. 12 and in this
paper, sec. 29 and 32.
    36. This has been answered just above, sec. 31.
    37. The soul is not diffused through the brain but is present to that
particular place, which is the sensorium.
    38. This is a bare assertion without proof. Two bodies void of elasticity
meeting each other with equal contrary forces both lose their motion.
And Sir Isaac Newton has given a mathematical instance (p. 341 of the
Latin Edition of his Optics)81 in which motion is continually diminishing
and increasing in quantity, without any communication of this to other
bodies.
    39. This is no defect as is here supposed, but it is the just and proper
nature of inert matter.
    40. This argument (if it is good) proves that the material world must be
infinite and that it must have been from eternity and must continue to
eternity, and that God must always have created as many men and as many
of all other things as it was possible for him to create and for as long a time
also as it was possible for him to do it.
    41. I do not understand what the meaning of these words is: "an order
(or situation) which makes bodies capable of being situated." lt seems to
me to amount to this: that situation is the cause of situation. That space is
not merely the order of bodies has been shown before (Third Reply, sec. 2
and 4), and that no answer has been given to the arguments there offered
has been shown in this paper, sec. 13 and 14. Also that time is not merely
the order of things succeeding each other is evident, because the quantity
of time may be greater or less and yet that order continue the same. The
order of things succeeding each other in time is not time itself, for they
may succeed each other faster or slower in the same order of succession
but not in the same time. If no creatures existed, still the ubiquity of God
and the continuance of his existence would make space and duration to be
exactly the same as they are now. 82
    42. This is appealing from reason to vulgar opinion, which philoso-
phers should not do, because it is not the rule of truth.
    43. Unusualness is necessarily included in the notion of a miracle. For
otherwise there is nothing more wonderful, nor that requires greater
power to effect, than some of those things we call natural, such as the

C/arke's Fourth Reply                                                       35

motions of the heavenly bodies, the generation and formation of plants
and animals, etc. Yet these are for this only reason not miracles, because
they are common. Nevertheless, it does not follow that everything which
is unusual is therefore a miracle. For it may be only the irregular and
more rare effect of usual causes, of which kind are eclipses, monstrous
births, madness in men, and innumerable things which the vulgar call
prodigies.
   44. This is a concession of what I advanced. And yet it is contrary to
the common opinion of theologians to suppose that an angel can work a
miracle.
   45. That one body should attract another without any intermediate
means is indeed not a miracle but a contradiction, for it is supposing
something to act where it is not. But the means by which two bodies
attract each other may be invisible and intangible, and of a different
nature from mechanism, and yet, acting regularly and constantly, may
well be called natural, being much less wonderful than animal motion,
which yet is never called a miracle.
   46. If the word natural forces means here mechanical, then all animals,
and even men, are as mere machines as a clock. But if the word does not
mean mechanical forces, then gravitation may be effected by regular and
natural powers, though they are not mechanical.

    N.B. The arguments advanced in the postscript to Mr. Leibniz's
fourth paper have been already answered in the foregoing replies. All that
needs here to be observed is that his notion concerning the impossibility
of physical atoms (for the question is not about mathematical atoms) is a
manifest absurdity. For either there are or there are not any perfectly solid
particles of matter. If there are any such, then the parts of such perfectly
solid particles, taken of equal figure and dimensions (which is always pos-
sible in supposition), are perfectly alike physical atoms. But if there are no
such perfectly solid particles, then there is no matter at all in the universe.
For the further the division and subdivision of the parts of any body is
carried before you arrive at parts perfectly solid and without pores, the
greater is the proportion of pores to solid matter in that body. If therefore
carrying on the division in infinitum you never arrive at parts perfectly
solid and without pores, it will follow that all bodies consist of pores only,
without any matter at all-which is a manifest absurdity. And the argu-
ment is the same with regard to the matter of which any particular species
of bodies is composed, whether its pores are supposed empty or always
full of extraneous matters.83

Leibniz's Fifth Letter, Being an Answer
to Clarke's Fourth Reply84
To Sections l and 2 of the Preceding Paper
    l. I shall at this time reply more amply to clear the difficulties and to test
whether the author is willing to listen to reason and to show that he is a
lover of truth, or whether he will only quibble without clearing anything.
    2. He often endeavors to impute to me necessity and fatality, though
perhaps no one has better and more fully explained than I have done in my
Theodicy the true difference between liberty, contingency, spontaneity, on
the one side, and absolute necessity, chance, coaction, on the other. I do
not know yet whether the author does this because he will do it, whatever I
may say, or whether he does it (supposing him sincere in those imputa-
tions) because he has not yet duly considered my opinions. I shall soon
find what I am to think of it, and I shall take my measures accordingly.
    3. lt is true that reasons in the mind of a wise being, and motives in any
mind whatsoever, do that which answers to the effect produced by
weights in a balance. 85 The author objects that this notion leads to neces-
sity and fatality. But he says so without proving it and without taking
notice of the explications I have formerly given in order to remove the dif-
ficulties that may be raised about that matter.
    4. He also seems to play with equivocal terms. There are necessities
that ought to be admitted. For we must distinguish between absolute and
hypothetical necessity. We must also distinguish between a necessity that
takes place because the opposite implies a contradiction (which necessity
is called logica~ metaphysical, or mathematical) and a necessity which is
moral, by which a wise being chooses the best and every mind follows the
strongest inclination.
    5. Hypothetical necessity is that which the supposition or hypothesis
of God's foresight and preordination imposes upon future contingents.
And this must necessarily be admitted, unless we deny, as the Socinians
do, God's foreknowledge of future contingents and his providence which
regulates and governs every particular thing.

 84. August 18, 1716. Leibniz made many additions and corrections in the mar-
gins of the copy of the letter he sent to Pierre Des Maizeaux. Clarke took account
of these changes in his published version ofLeibniz's Fifth Letter in French. The
following note occurs at the beginning of that letter: "The variant read in gs pr in ted
in the margin of the following paper are changes made in Leibniz'sown hand in an-
other copy of this paper which he sent to one of his friends in England a short time
before his death." We have inserted the changes within angle brackets in the text.
 85. See Appendix A, no. 3.
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                       37

    6. But neither that foreknowledge nor that preordination derogate
from liberty. For God, being moved by his supreme reason to choose,
among many series of things or possible worlds, that in which free crea-
tures should take such or such resolutions, though not without his con-
course, has thereby rendered every event certain and determined once for
all, without thereby derogating from the liberty of those creatures that
simple decree of choice, not at all changing but only actualizing their free
natures which he saw in his ideas.
    7. As for moral necessity, this also does not derogate from liberty. For
when a wise being, and especially God who has supreme wisdom, chooses
what is best, he is not the less free on that account; on the contrary, it is
the most perfect liberty not to be hindered from acting in the best man-
ner. And when any other chooses according to the most apparent and the
most strongly inclining good, he imitates in this the liberty of a truly wise
being, in proportion to his disposition. Without this, the choice would be
a blind chance.
    8. But good, either true or apparent-in a word, the motive-inclines
without necessitating, that is, without imposing an absolute necessity. For
when God (for instance) chooses the best, what he does not choose, and is
inferior in perfection, is nevertheless possible. But if what he chooses was
absolutely necessary, any other way would be impossible-which is
against the hypothesis. For God chooses among possibles, that is, among
many ways none of which implies a contradiction.
    9. But to say that God can only choose what is best, and to infer from
this that what he does not choose is impossible, this, I say, is confounding
of terms; it is blending power and will, metaphysical necessity and moral
necessity, essences and existences. For what is necessary is so by its
essence, since the opposite implies a contradiction; but a contingent that
exists owes its existence to the princip le of what is best, which is a suffi-
cient reason for the existence of things. And therefore I say that motives
incline without necessitating, and that there is a certainty and infallibility,
but not an absolute necessity in contingent things. Add to this what will
be said below, in nos. 73 and 76.
    l O. And I have sufficiently shown in my Theodicy that this moral
necessity is a good thing, agreeable to the divine perfection, agreeable to
the great princip le or ground of existences, which is that of the need for
a sufficient reason, whereas absolute and metaphysical necessity
depends on the other great principle of our reasonings, namely, that of
essences, that is, the princip le of identity or contradiction. For what is
absolutely necessary is the only possible way, and its contrary implies a
contradiction.
    ll. I have also shown that our will does not always exactly follow the
38                                                         The Correspondence

practical understanding, because it may have or find reasons to suspend
its resolution until a further examination.
    12. To impute to me after this the notion of an absolute necessity, with-
out having anything to say against the reasons which I have just now
advanced and which go to the bottom of things, perhaps beyond what is to
be seen elsewhere, this, I say, will be an unreasonable obstinacy.
    13. As to the notion of fatality which the author also lays to my charge,
this is another ambiguity. There is afatum Mahometanum, afotum
Stoicum, and afotum Christianum. The Turkish fate will have an effect
happen even though its cause should be avoided, as if there was an abso-
lute necessity. The Stoical fate will have a man be quiet because he must
have patience whether he will or not, since it is impossible to resist the
course of things. But it is agreed that there is fatum Christianum, a certain
destiny of everything, regulated by the foreknowledge and providence of
God. Fatum is derived from fori, that is, to pronounce, to decree, and in its
right sense it signifies the decree of providence. And those who submit to
it through a knowledge of the divine perfections, of which the love of God
is a consequence <since it consists in the pleasure which this knowledge
gives>, have not only patience like the heathen philosophers, but are also
contented with what is ordained by God, knowing he does everything for
the best and not only for the greatest good in general, but also for the
greatest particular good of those who love him.
    14. I have been obliged to enlarge in order to remove ill-grounded
imputations once for all, as I hope I shall be able to do by these explana-
tions, so as to satisfy fair-minded persons. I shall now come to an objec-
tion raised here against my comparing the weights of a balance with the
motives of the will. lt is objected that a balance is merely passive and
moved by the weights, whereas intelligent agents endowed with will are
active. To this I answer that the princip le of the need for a sufficient rea-
son is common both to agents and patients;86 they need a sufficient reason
for their action as well as for their passion. A balance not only does not act
when it is equally pulled on both sides, but the equal weights likewise do
not act when they are in an equilibrium, so that one of them cannot go
down without the others rising up as much.
    15. It must also be considered that, properly speaking, motives do not
act on the mind as weights do on a balance, but it is rather the mind that
acts by virtue of the motives, which are its dispositions to act. And there-
fore to claim, as the author does here, that the mind sometimes prefers
weak motives to strong ones, and even that it prefers that which is indif-
ferent before motives, this, I say, is to divide the mind from the motives,

 86. See Appendix A, no. 3.
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                     39

as if they were outside the mind as the weight is distinct from the balance
and as if the mind had, besides motives, other dispositions to act by virtue
of which it could reject or accept the motives. Whereas, in truth, the
motives comprehend all the dispositions which the mind can have to act
voluntarily, for they include not only the reasons, but also the inclinations
arising from passions or other preceding impressions. For this reason, if
the mind should prefer a weak inclination to a strong one, it would act
against itself and otherwise than it is disposed to act. This shows that the
author's notions, contrary to mine, are superficial and appear to have no
solidity in them when they are well considered.
    16. To assert also that the mind may have good reasons to act when it
has no motives and when things are absolutely indifferent, as the author
explains himself here, this, I say, is a manifest contradiction. For if the
mind has good reasons for taking the part it takes, then the things are not
indifferent to the mind.
    17. And to affirm that the mind will act when it has reasons to act, even
though the ways of acting were absolutely indifferent, this, I say, is to
speak again very superficially and in a manner that cannot be defended.
For a man never has a sufficient reason to act when he does not also have a
sufficient reason to act in a certain particular manner, every action being
individual and not general, nor abstract from its circumstances, but
always needing some particular way of being put in execution. For this
reason, when there is a sufficient reason to do any particular thing, there
is also a sufficient reason to do it in a certain particular manner; and con-
sequently several manners of doing it are not indifferent. As often as a
man has sufficient reasons for a single action, he has also sufficient rea-
sons for all its requirements. See also what I shall say below, no. 66.
    18. These arguments are very obvious, and it is very strange to charge
me with advancing my principle of the need for a sufficient reason with-
out any proof drawn either from the nature of things or from the divine
perfections. For the nature of things requires that every event should have
beforehand its proper conditions, requirements, and dispositions, the
existence of which makes the sufficient reason of such an event.
    19. And God's perfection requires that all his actions should be agree-
able to his wisdom and that it may not be said of him that he has acted
without reason, or even that he has preferred a weaker reason before a
stronger.
    20. But I shall speak more largely at the conclusion of this paper con-
cerning the solidity and importance of this great princip le of the need for
a sufficient reason for every event, the overthrowing of which principle
would overthrow the best part of all philosophy. lt is therefore very
strange that the author should say I am guilty of begging the question in
40                                                         The Correspondence

this, and it plainly appears he is desirous to maintain indefensible opin-
ions, since he is reduced to deny that great principle which is one of the
most essential principles of reason.

To Sections 3 and 4
    21. lt must be confessed that though this great principle has been
acknowledged, yet it has not been sufficiently made use of. This is in great
measure the reason why first philosophy87 has not been as fruitful and
demonstrative up to now as it should have been. I infer from that princi-
ple, among other consequences, that there are not in nature two real,
absolute beings, indiscernible from each other, because if there were, God
and nature would act without reason in treating the one otherwise than
the other, and that therefore God does not produce two pieces of matter
perfectly equal and alike. The author answers this conclusion without
refuting its reason, and he answers with a very weak objection. "That
argument," he says, "if it was good, would prove that it would be impossi-
ble for God to create any matter at all. For the perfectly solid parts of mat-
ter, if we take them of equal figure and dimensions (which is always
possible in supposition), would be exactly alike." But it is manifestly beg-
ging the question to suppose that perfect likeness, which, according to
me, cannot be admitted. This supposition of two indiscernibles, such as
two pieces of matter perfectly alike, seems indeed to be possible in
abstract terms, but it is not consistent with the order of things, nor with
the divine wisdom by which nothing is admitted without reason. The vul-
gar fancy such things because they content themselves with incomplete
no tions. And this is one of the faults of the atomists.
    22. Besides, I do not admit in matter parts perfectly solid, or that are
the same throughout without any variety or particular motion in their
parts, as the pretended atoms are imagined to be. To suppose such bodies
is another ill-grounded popular opinion. According to my demonstra-
tions, every part of matter is actually subdivided into parts differently
moved, and no one of them is perfectly like another.
    23. I said that in sensible things two that are indiscernible from each
other can never be found, that (for instance) two leaves in a garden or two
drops of water perfectly alike are not to be found. The author acknowl-
edges it as to leaves and perhaps as to drops of water. But he might have
admitted it without any hesitation, without a perhaps (an Italian would say
senza forse), as to drops of water likewise.
    24. I believe that these general observations in things sensible hold also

 87. That is, metaphysics.
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                    41

in proportion in things insensible, and that one may say in this respect
what Harlequin says in the Emperor of the Moon: it is there, just as it is
here. And it is a great objection against indiscernibles that no instance of
them is to be found. But the author opposes this consequence, because
(he says) sensible bodies are composed, whereas he maintains there are
insensible bodies which are simple. I answer again that I do not admit
simple bodies. There is nothing simple in my opinion but true monads,
which have neither parts nor extension. Simple bodies, and even perfectly
similar ones, are a consequence of the false hypothesis of a vacuum and of
atoms, or of lazy philosophy, which does not sufficiently carry on the anal-
ysis of things and fancies it can attain to the first material elements of
nature, because our imagination would be satisfied with this.
   25. When I deny that there are two drops of water perfectly alike, or
any two other bodies indiscemible from each other, I do not say it is abso-
lutely impossible to suppose them, but that it is a thing contrary to the
divine wisdom, and which consequently does not exist.

To Sections 5 and 6
   26. I admit that if two things perfectly indiscernible from each other
did exist, they would be two, but that supposition is false and contrary to
the great principle of reason. The vulgar philosophers were mistaken
when they believed that there are things different solo numero, 88 or only
because they are two, and from this error have arisen their perplexities
about what they called the princip/e of individuation. Metaphysics has gen-
erally been handled like a science of mere words, like a philosophical dic-
tionary, without entering into the discussion of things. Superficial
philosophy, such as is that of the atomists and vacuists, forges things
which superior reasons do not admit. I hope my demonstrations will
change the face of philosophy, notwithstanding such weak objections as
the author raises here against me.
   27. The parts of time or place considered in themselves are ideal
things, and therefore they perfectly resemble one another like two
abstract units. But it is not so with two concrete ones, or with two real
times, or two spaces filled up, that is, truly actual.
   28. I do not say that two points of space are one and the same point,
nor that two instants of time are one and the same instant, as the author
seems to charge me with saying. But a man may fancy, for lack of knowl-
edge, that there are two different instants where there is but one; in like
manner, as I observed in section seventeen of the preceding answer, that

 88. "ln number alone."
42                                                        The Correspondence

frequently in geometry we suppose two, in order to represent the error of
a refuter, when there is really but one. If any man should suppose that a
right line cuts another in two points, it will be found after all that those
two pretended points must coincide and make but one point.
   29. I have demonstrated that space is nothing else but an order of the
existence of things observed as existing together, and therefore the fiction
of a material finite universe moving forward in an infinite empty space
cannot be admitted. 89 lt is altogether unreasonable and impracticable. For
besides the fact that there is no real space out of the material universe,
such an action would be without any design in it; it would be working
without doing anything, agendo nihil agere. 90 There would hap pen no
change which could be observed by any person whatsoever. These are
imaginations of philosophers who have incomplete notions, who make
space an absolute reality. Mere mathematicians who are only taken up
with the conceits of imagination are apt to forge such notions, but they are
destroyed by superior reasons.
   30. Absolutely speaking, it appears that God can make the material
universe finite in extension, but the contrary appears more agreeable to
his wisdom.
   31. I do not grant that every finite is movable. According to the
hypothesis of my adversaries themselves, a part of space, though finite, is
not movable. What is movable must be capable of changing its situation
with respect to something else and to be in a new state discernible from
the first; otherwise the change is but a fiction. A movable finite must
therefore make part of another finite, so that any change may happen
which can be observed.
   32. Descartes maintains that matter is unlimited, and I do not think he
has been sufficiently confuted. And though this is granted him, it does
not follow that matter would be necessary, nor that it would have existed
from all eternity, since that unlimited diffusion of matter would only be
an effect of God's choice judging that to be the better.

To Section 7
   33. Since space in itself is an ideal thing like time, space out of the
world must necessarily be imaginary, as the schoolmen themselves have
acknowledged. The case is the same with empty space within the world,
which I take also to be imaginary, for the reasons before adduced.
   34. The author objects against me the vacuum discovered by Mr.

Guericke 91 of Magdeburg, which is made by pumping the air out of a
receiver, and he claims that there is truly a perfect vacuum or a space with-
out matter (at least in part) in that receiver. The Aristotelians and Carte-
sians, who do not admit a true vacuum, have said in answer to that
experiment of Mr. Guericke, as well as to that of Torricelli92 of Florence
(who emptied the air out of a glass tube by the help of mercury), that there
is no vacuum at all in the tube or in the receiver, since glass has small pores
which the beams of light, the effiuvia of the magnet, and other very thin
fluids may go through. I am of their opinion, and I think the receiver may
be compared to a box full of holes in the water, having fish or other gross
bodies shut up in it, which, being taken out, their place would nevertheless
be filled up with water. There is only this difference: that though water is
fluid and more yielding than those gross bodies, yet it is as heavy and mas-
sive, if not more, than they, whereas the matter which gets into the receiver
in the room of the air is much more subtle. The new partisans of a vacuum
advance in answer to this instance that it is not the grossness of matter but
its mere quantity that makes resistance, and consequently that there is of
necessity more vacuum where there is less resistance. They add that the
subtleness of matter has nothing to do here and that the particles of quick-
silver are as subtle and fine as those of water, and yet that quicksilver resists
about ten times more. To this I reply that it is not so much the quantity of
matter as its difficulty of giving place that makes resistance. For instance,
floating timber contains less of heavy matter than an equal bulk of water
does, and yet it makes more resistance to a boat than the water does.
    35. And as for quicksilver, it is true that it contains about fourteen
times more of heavy matter than an equal bulk of water does, but it does
not follow that it contains fourteen times more matter absolutely. On the
contrary, water contains as much matter, if we include both its own mat-
ter, which is heavy, and the extraneous matter void of heaviness which
passes through its pores. For both quicksilver and water are masses of
heavy matter, full of pores, through which there passes a great deal of
matter void of heaviness <and which makes no sensible resistance>, such
as is probably that of the rays of light and other insensible fluids, and
especially that which is itself the cause of the gravity of gross bodies by
receding from the center toward which it drives those bodies. For it is a
strange imagination to make all matter gravitate, and that toward all other
matter, as if each body did equally attract every other body according to

 91. Otto von Guericke (1602- 1686) was an experirnentalist and the inventor of
the air pump.

the barometer.

their masses and distances, and this by an attraction properly so called,
which is not derived from an occult impulse of bodies, whereas the grav-
ity of sensible bodies toward the center of the earth ought to be produced
by the motion of some fluid. And the case must be the same with other
gravities, such as is that of the planets toward the sun or toward each
other. <A body is never moved naturally except by another body that
touches it and pushes it; after that it continues until it is prevented by
another body that touches it. Any other kind of operation on bodies is
either miraculous or imaginary>.

To Sections 8 and 9
    36. l objected that space, taken for something real and absolute without
bodies, would be a thing eternal, unaffected, and independent of God.
The author endeavors to elude this difficulty by saying that space is a
property of God. ln answer to this I have said, in my foregoing paper, that
the property of God is immensity but that space (which is often commen-
surate with bodies) and God's immensity are not the same thing.
    37. l objected further that if space is a property, and infinite space is
the immensity of God, finite space will be the extension or measurability
of something finite. And therefore the space taken up by a body will be the
extension of that body. This is an absurdity, since a body can change space
but cannot leave its extension.
    38. I asked also, if space is a property, what thing will an empty limited
space (such as that which my adversary imagines in an exhausted receiver)
be the property of? lt does not appear reasonable to say that this empty
space, either round or square, is a property of God. Will it be then per-
haps the property of some immaterial, extended, imaginary substances
which the author seems to fancy in the imaginary spaces?
    39. If space is the property or affection of the substance which is in
space, the same space will be sometimes the affection of one body, some-
times of another body, sometimes of an immaterial substance, and some-
times perhaps of God himself, when it is void of all other substance,
material or immaterial. But this is a strange property or affection, which
passes from one subject to another. Thus subjects will leave off their acci-
dents, like clothes, so that other subjects may put them on. At this rate
how shall we distinguish accidents and substances?
    40. And if limited spaces are the affections of limited substances which
are in them, and infinite space is a property of God, a property of God
must (which is very strange) be made up of the affections of creatures, for
all finite spaces taken together make up infinite space.
    41. But if the author denies that limited space is an affection of limited
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                            45

things, it will not be reasonable either that infinite space should be the
affection or property of an infinite thing. I have suggested all these diffi-
culties in my foregoing paper, but it does not appear that the author has
endeavored to answer them.
    42. I have still other reasons against this strange imagination that space
is a property of God. If it is so, space belongs to the essence of God. But
space has parts; therefore there would be parts in the essence of God.
Spectatum admissi. 93
    43. Moreover, spaces are sometimes empty and sometimes filled up.
Therefore there will be in the essence of God parts sometimes empty and
sometimes full and consequently liable to a perpetual change. Bodies fill-
ing up space would fill up part of God's essence and would be commen-
surate with it; and in the supposition of a vacuum, part of God's essence
will be within the receiver. Such a God having parts will very much
resemble the Stoics' God, which was the whole universe considered as a
divine animal.
    44. If infinite space is God's immensity, infinite time will be God's
eternity; and therefore we must say that what is in space is in God's
immensity, and consequently in his essence, and that what is in time <is
in the eternity of God and> is also in the essence of God. Strange expres-
sions, which plainly show that the author makes a wrong use of terms.
    45. I shall give another instance of this. God's immensity makes him
actually present in all spaces. But now if God is in space, how can it be
said that space is in God or that it is a property of God? We have often
heard that a property is in its subject, but we never heard that a subject is
in its property. In like manner, God exists in all time. How then can time
be in God, and how can it be a property of God? These are perpetual
alloglossies. 94
    46. It appears that the author confounds immensity, or the extension of
things, with the space according to which that extension is taken. Infinite
space is not the immensity of God; finite space is not the extension of bod-
ies, as time is not their duration. Things keep their extension, but they do
not always keep their space. Everything has its own extension, its own
duration, but it does not have its own time and does not keep its own space.
    47. I will here show how men come to form the notion of space to
themselves. They consider that many things exist at once, and they
observe in them a certain order of coexistence, according to which the
relation of one thing to another is more or less simple. This order is their

 93. This is a reference to Horace, De Arte Poetica, 1.5: "Spectatum admissi risum
teneatis amici [If you saw such a thing, could you refrain your laughter, friends]?"
 94. That is, barbaric or strange expressions.
46                                                          The Correspondence

situation or distance. When it happens that one of those coexistent things
changes its relation to a multitude of others which do not change their
relation among themselves, and that another thing, newly come, acquires
the same relation to the others as the former had, we then say that it is
come into the place of the former; and this change we call a motion in that
body in which is the immediate cause of the change. And though many, or
even all, the coexistent things should change according to certain known
rules of direction and speed, yet one may always determine the relation of
situation which every coexistent acquires with respect to every other
coexistent, and even that relation which any other coexistent would have
to this, or which this would have to any other, if it had not changed or if it
had changed any other way. And supposing or feigning that among those
coexistents there is a sufficient number of them which have undergone no
change, then we may say that those which have such a relation to those
fixed existents as others had to them before, have now the same place
which those others had. And that which comprehends all those places is
called space. This shows that, in order to have an idea of place and conse-
quently of space, it is sufficient to consider these relations and the rules of
their changes, without needing to fancy any absolute reality out of the
things whose situation we consider. And, to give a kind of a definition:
place is that which we say is the same to A and to B when the relation of
the coexistence of B with e, E, F, G, etc. agrees perfectly with the relation
of the coexistence which A had with the same e, E, F, G, etc., supposing
there has been no cause of change in C, E, F, G, etc. It may be said also,
without entering into any further particularity, that place is that which is
the same in different moments to different existent things when their
relations of coexistence with certain other existents which are supposed to
continue fixed from one of those moments to the other agree entirely
together. And .fixed existents are those in which there has been no cause of
any change of the order of their coexistence with others, or (which is the
same thing) in which there has been no motion. Lastly, space is that which
results from places taken together. And here it may not be amiss to con-
sider the difference between place and the relation of situation which is in
the body that fills up the place. For the place of A and B is the same,
whereas the relation of A to fixed bodies is not precisely and individually
the same as the relation which B (that comes into its place) will have to the
same fixed bodies; but these relations agree only. For two different sub-
jects, such as A and B, cannot have precisely the same individual affec-
tion, since it is impossible that the same individual accident should be in
two subjects or pass from one subject to another. But the mind, not con-
tented with an agreement, looks for an identity, for something that should
be truly the same, and conceives it as being extrinsic to the subjects; and
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                      47

this is what we call place and space. But this can only be an ideal thing,
containing a certain order, in which the mind conceives the application of
relations. ln like manner, as the mind can fancy to itself an order made up
of genealogicallines whose size would consist only in the number of gen-
erations, in which every person would have his place; and if should add to
this one the fiction of a metempsychosis and bring in the same human
souls again, the persons in those lines might change place; he who was a
father or a grandfather might become a son or a grandson, etc. And yet
those genealogical places, lines, and spaces, though they should express
real truth, would only be ideal things. I shall adduce another example to
show how the mind uses, on occasion of accidents which are in subjects,
to fancy to itself something answerable to those accidents out of the sub-
jects. The ratio or proportion between two lines L and M may be con-
ceived three several ways: as a ratio of the greater L to the lesser M; as a
ratio of the lesser M to the greater L; and lastly as something abstracted
from both, that is, as the ratio between L and M without considering
which is the antecedent or which the consequent, which the subject and
which the object. And thus it is that proportions are considered in music.
ln the first way of considering them, L the greater, in the second, M the
lesser, is the subject of that accident which philosophers call relation. But
which of them will be the subject in the third way of considering them? lt
cannot be said that both of them, L and M together, are the subject of
such an accident; for if so, we should have an accident in two subjects,
with one leg in one and the other in the other, which is contrary to the
notion of accidents. Therefore we must say that this relation, in this third
way of considering it, is indeed out of the subjects; but being neither a
substance nor an accident, it must be a mere ideal thing, the consideration
of which is nevertheless useful. To conclude, I have done here much like
Euclid, who, not being able to make his readers well understand what ratio
is absolutely in the sense of geometers, defines what are the same ratios.
Thus, in like manner, in order to explain what place is, I have been content
to define what is the same place. Lastly, I observe that the traces of movable
bodies, which they leave sometimes on the immovable ones on which they
are moved, have given men occasion to form such an idea in their imagi-
nation, as if some trace did still remain even when there is nothing
unmoved. But this is a mere ideal thing and imports only that if there was
any unmoved thing there, the trace might be marked out on it. And it is
this analogy which makes men fancy places, traces, and spaces, though
those things consist only in the truth of relations, and not at all in any
absolute reality.
    48. To conclude, if the space (which the author fancies) void of all bod-
ies is not altogether empty, what is it then full of? Is it full of extended
48                                                         The Correspondence

spirits perhaps, or immaterial substances capable of extending and con-
tracting themselves, which move in there and penetrate each other with-
out any inconvenience, as the shadows of two bodies penetrate one
another on the surface of a wall? l think l see the revival of the odd imagi-
nations of Dr. Henry More (otherwise a learned and well-meaning man)
and of some others who fancied that those spirits can make themselves
impenetrable whenever they please. No, some have fancied that man in
the state of innocence also had the gift of penetration, and that he became
solid, opaque, and impenetrable by his fall. ls it not overthrowing our
notions of things to make God have parts, to make spirits have extension?
The principle of the need for a sufficient reason does alone drive away all
these specters of imagination. Men easily run into fictions for lack of
making a right use of that great principle.

To Section 10
    49. lt cannot be said that <a certain> duration is eternal but <it can be
said> that the things which continue always are eternal <always gaining a
new duration>. Whatever exists of time and of duration <being succes-
sive>, perishes continually, and how can a thing exist eternally which (to
speak exactly) never does exist at all? For how can a thing exist of which
no part ever does exist? Nothing of time does ever exist but instants, and
an instant is not even itself a part of time. Whoever considers these obser-
vations will easily apprehend that time can only be an ideal thing. And the
analogy between time and space will easily make it appear that the one is
as merely ideal as the other. <But if in saying that the duration of a thing
is eternal, it is only meant that the thing endures eternally, I have nothing
to say against it.>
    50. If the reality of space and time is necessary to the immensity and
eternity of God, if God must be in space, if being in space is a property of
God, he will in some measure depend on time and space and stand in
need of them. For I have already prevented that subterfuge-that space
and time are <in God and like> properties of God. <Could one maintain
the opinion that bodies move in the parts of the divine essence?>

To Sections ll and 12
   51. I objected that space cannot be in God because it has parts. Here-
upon the author seeks another subterfuge by departing from the received
sense of words, maintaining that space has no parts because its parts are
not separable and cannot be removed from one another by being plucked
out. But it is sufficient that space has parts, whether those parts are sepa-
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                        49

rahle or not, and they may be assigned in space, either by the bodies that
are in it or by lines and surfaces that may be drawn and described in it.

To Section 13
    52. ln order to prove that space without bodies is an absolute reality,
the author objected that a finite material universe might move forward in
space. I answered that it does not appear reasonable that the material uni-
verse should be finite; and although we should suppose it to be finite, yet
it is unreasonable it should have motion otherwise than as its parts change
their situation among themselves, because such a motion would produce
no change that could be observed95 and would be without design. lt is
another thing when its parts change their situation among themselves, for
then there is a motion in space, but it consists in the order of relations
which are changed. The author replies now that the reality of motion does
not depend on being observed, and that a ship may go forward, and yet a
man who is in the ship may not consciously perceive it. I answer that
motion does not indeed depend on being observed, but it does depend on
being able to be observed. There is no motion when there is no change
that can be observed. And when there is no change that can be observed,
there is no change at all. The contrary opinion is grounded on the suppo-
sition of a real absolute space, which I have demonstratively refuted by
the princip le of the need for a sufficient reason of things.
    53. I find nothing in the eighth definition of the Mathematical Princip/es
of Nature, nor in the scholium belonging to it, that proves or can prove the
reality of space in itself. 96 However, I grant there is a difference between an
absolute true motion of a body and a mere relative change of its situation
with respect to another body. For when the immediate cause of the change
is in the body, that body is truly in motion, and then the situation of other
bodies, with respect to it will be changed consequently, though the cause
of that change is not in them. lt is true that, exactly speaking, there is not
any one body that is perfectly and entirely at rest, but we frame an abstract
notion of rest by considering the thing mathematically. Thus have I left
nothing unanswered of what has been advanced for the absolute reality of
space. And I have demonstrated the falsehood of that reality by a funda-
mental principle, one of the most certain both in reason and experience,
against which no exception or instance can be advanced. On the whole,
one may judge from what has been said that I must not admit a movable
universe, nor any place out of the material universe.

To Section 14
    54. I am not aware of any objection but what I think I have sufficiently
answered. As for the objection that space and time are quantities, or
rather things endowed with quantity, and that situation and order are not
so, I answer that order also has its quantity: there is in it that which goes
before and that which follows; there is distance or interval. Relative things
have their quantity as well as absolute ones. For instance, ratios or propor-
tions in mathematics have their quantity and are measured by logarithms,
and yet they are relations. And therefore though time and space consist in
relations, still they have their quantity.

To Section lS
    55. As to the question whether God could have created the world
sooner, it is necessary here to understand each other rightly. Since I have
demonstrated that time without things is nothing else but a mere ideal
possibility, it is manifest that if anyone should say that this same world
which has been actually created might have been created sooner without
any other change, he would say nothing that is intelligible. For there is no
mark or difference by which it would be possible to know that this world
was created sooner. And therefore (as I have already said) to suppose that
God created the same world sooner is supposing a chimerical thing. It is
making time an absolute thing, independent of God, whereas time does
only coexist with creatures and is only conceived by the order and quan-
tity of their changes.
    56. But yet absolutely speaking
one may conceive that an universe
                                             R   r--        s
                                                l       \
began sooner than it actually did. Let
us suppose our universe or any other            l        \
to be represented by the Figure AF,          A               B
and that the ordinate AB represents
its first state and the ordinates CD
and EF its following states; I say one
                                            e
may conceive that such a world
began sooner by conceiving the fig-
ure prolonged backwards, and by
adding to it SRABS. For thus, things
being increased, time will be also
increased. But whether such an aug-             .__ _ __.F
mentation is reasonable and agree-           E
able to God's wisdom is another question to which we answer in the
negative; otherwise God would have made such an augmentation. lt
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                           51

would be like as Humano capi ti cervicem pictor equinam jungere si velit.91
The case is the same with respect to the destruction98 of the universe. As
one might conceive something added to the beginning, so one might also
conceive something taken off toward the end. But such a retrenching
from it would be also unreasonable.
    57. Thus it appears how we are to understand that God created things
at what time he pleased, for this depends on the things he resolved to cre-
ate. But things being once resolved on, together with their relations, there
remains no longer any choice about the time and the place, which of
themselves have nothing in them real, nothing that can distinguish them,
nothing that is at all discernible.
    58. One cannot therefore say, as the author does here, that the wisdom
of God may have good reasons to create this world99 at such or such a par-
ticular time, since that particular time considered without the things is an
impossible fiction, and good reasons for a choice are not to be found
where everything is indiscernible.
    59. When I speak of this world, I mean the whole universe of material
and immaterial creatures taken together, from the beginning of things.
But if anyone means only the beginning of the material world, and sup-
poses immaterial creatures before it, he would have somewhat more rea-
son for his supposition. For time then being marked by things that existed
already, it would be no longer indifferent, and there might be room for
choice. And yet, indeed, this would be only putting off the difficulty. For
supposing the whole universe of immaterial and material creatures
together to have a beginning, there is no longer any choice about the time
in which God would place that beginning.
    60. And therefore one must not say, as the author does here, that God
created things in what particular space and at what particular time he
pleased. For all time and all spaces being in themselves perfectly uniform
and indiscernible from each other, one of them cannot please more than
another.
    61. I shall not enlarge here on my opinion explained elsewhere that
there are no created substances wholly destitute of matter. For I hold with
the ancients and according to reason that angels or intelligences, and souls
separated from a gross body, always have subtle bodies, though they

themselves are incorporeal. The vulgar philosophy easily admits all sorts
of fictions; mine is more strict.
    62. I do not say that matter and space are the same thing. I only say
that there is no space where there is no matter and that space in itself is
not an absolute reality. Space and matter differ as time and motion. How-
ever, these things, though different, are inseparable.
    63. But yet it does not at all follow that matter is etemal and necessary,
unless we suppose space to be eternal and necessary-a supposition ill
ground ed in all respects.

To Sections 16 and 17
   64. I think I have answered everything, and I have particularly replied
to that objection that space and time have quantity and that order has
none. See above, no. 54.
   65. I have clearly shown that the contradiction lies in the hypothesis of
the opposite opinion, which looks for a difference where there is none.
And it would be a manifest iniquity to infer from this that I have acknowl-
edged a contradiction in my own opinion.

To Section 18
   66. Here I find again an argument which I have overthrown above, no.
17. The author says that God may have good reasons to make two cubes
perfectly equal and alike, and then (he says) God must necessarily assign
them their places, although every other respect is perfectly equal. But
things ought not to be separated from their circumstances. This argu-
ment consists in incomplete nations. Gad's resolutions are never abstract
and imperfect, as if God decreed first to create the two cubes and then
made another decree where to place them. Men, being such limited crea-
tures as they are, may act in this manner. They may resolve on a thing
and then find themselves perplexed about means, ways, places, and cir-
cumstances. But God never takes a resolution about the ends without
resolving at the same time about the means and all the circumstances.
No, I have shown in my Theodicy that, properly speaking, there is but one
decree for the whole universe, by which God resolved to bring it out of
possibility into existence. And therefore God will not choose a cube with-
out choosing its place at the same time, and he will never choose among
indiscernibles.
   67. The parts of space are not determined and distinguished only by
the things which are in it, and the diversity of things in space determines
God to act differently on different parts of space. But space without
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                      53

things has nothing by which it may be distinguished and, indeed, not any-
thing actual.
   68. If God is resolved to place a certain cube of matter at all, he is also
resolved in what particular place to put it. But it is with respect to other
parts of matter, and not with respect to bare space itself, in which there is
nothing to distinguish it.
   69. But wisdom does not allow God to place at the same time two
cubes perfectly equal and atike, because there is no way to find any reason
for assigning them different places. At this rate there would be a will
without a motive. 100
   70. A will without motive (such as superficial reasonings suppose to be
in God) I compared to Epicurus' chance. The author answers that Epicu-
rus' chance is a blind necessity and not a choice of will. I reply that Epicu-
rus' chance is not a necessity but something indifferent. Epicurus
brought it in on purpose to avoid necessity. It is true that chance is blind,
but a will without motive would be no less blind and no less owing to mere
chance.

To Section 19
   71. The author repeats here what has been already refuted above, no.
21, that matter cannot be created without God's choosing among indis-
cernibles. He would be in the right if matter consisted of atoms, similar
particles, or other comparable fictions of superficial philosophy. But that
great principle which proves there is no choice among indiscernibles also
destroys these ill-contrived fictions.

To Section 20
   72. The author objected against me in his Third Reply (nos. 7 and 8)
that God would not have in himself a princip le of acting, if he was deter-
mined by external things. I answered that the ideas of external things are
in him and that therefore he is determined by internal reasons, that is, by
his wisdom. But the author here will not understand to what end I said it.

To Section 21
   73. He frequently confounds in his objections against me what God
will not do with what he cannot do. See above, no. 9 <and below no. 76>.
For example, God can do everything that is possible, but he will do only
what is best. And therefore I do not say, as the author here will have it,

that God cannot limit the extension of matter, but it is likely he will not do
it and that he has thought it better to set no bounds to matter.
    74. From extension to duration, non valet consequentia. 101 Though the
extension of matter was unlimited, yet it would not follow that its dura-
tion would be also unlimited; no, even in the direction of the past it would
not follow that it had no beginning. If it is the nature of things in the
whole to grow uniformly in perfection, the universe of creatures must
have had a beginning. And therefore there will be reasons to limit the
duration of things, even though there were none to limit their extension.
Besides, the world's having a beginning does not derogate from the infin-
ity of its duration a parte post, or in the direction of the future, but bounds
of the universe would derogate from the infinity of its extension. And
therefore it is more reasonable to admit a beginning of the world than to
admit any bounds of it, that the character of its infinite author may be
preserved in both respects.
    75. However, those who have admitted the eternity of the world or, at
least (as some famous theologians have done), the possibility of its eter-
nity, did not for all that deny its dependence on God, as the author here
lays to their charge without any ground.

To Sections 22 and 23
    76. He here further objects, without any reason, that according to my
opinion whatever God can do, he must necessarily have done-as if he
was ignorant that I have solidly confuted this notion in my Theodicy and
that I have overthrown the opinion of those who maintain that there is
nothing possible but what really happens, as some ancient philosophers
did, and among others Diodorus in Cicero. 102 The author confounds
moral necessity, which proceeds from the choice of what is best, with
absolute necessity; he confounds the will of God with his power. God can
produce everything that is possible or whatever does not imply a contra-
diction, but he wills only to produce what is the best among things possi-
ble. See what has been said above, no. 9 <and no. 74>.
    77. God is not therefore a necessary agent in producing creatures,
since he acts with choice. However, what the author adds here is ill
grounded, namely, that a necessary agent would not be an agent at all. He
frequently affirms things boldly and without any ground, advancing
<against me> notions which cannot be proved.

To Sections 24-28
   78. The author alleges that it was not affirmed that space is "God's
sensorium," but only "as it were his sensorium." The latter seems to be as
improper and as little intelligible as the former.

To Section 29

   79. Space is not the place of all things, for it is not the place of God.
Otherwise there would be a thing coeternal with God and independent of
him; no, he himself would depend on it, if he has need of p lace.
   80. Nor do I see how it can be said that space is the place of ideas, for
ideas are in the understanding.
   81. It is also very strange to say that the soul of man is the soul of the
images it possesses. The images, which are in the understanding, are in
the mind, but if the mind was the soul of the images, they would then be
extrinsic to it. And if the author means corporeal images, how then will he
have a human mind be the soul of those images, since they are only tran-
sient impressions in a body belonging to that soul?
   82. If it is by means of a sensorium that God perceives what passes in the
world, it seems that things act on him and that therefore he is what we mean
by a soul of the world. The author charges me with repeating objections
without taking notice of the answers, but I do not see that he has answered
this difficulty. They had better wholly lay aside this pretended sensorium.

To Section 30

   83. The author speaks as if he did not understand how, according to
my opinion, the soul is a representative principle. This is as if he had
never heard of my pre-established harmony. 103
   84. I do not assent to the vulgar nations that the images of things are
conveyed by the organs (of sense) to the soul. For it is not conceivable by
what passage, or by what means of conveyance, these images can be car-
ried from the organ to the soul. This vulgar notion in philosophy is not
intelligible, as the new Cartesians have sufficiently shown. lt cannot be
explained how immaterial substance is affected by matter, and to maintain
an unintelligible notion about this is having recourse to the scholastic chi-
merical notion of I-know-not-what inexplicable intentional species, 104

103. See Appendix A, no. 5.
104. ln scholastic doctrine intentional or intelligible species (species intentionales,
as Clarke has it) were used to explain sense perception; see, for example, Thomas
Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I, quest. 85, art. 2.
56                                                       The Correspondence

passing from the organs to the soul. Those Cartesians saw the difficulty,
but they could not explain it. They had recourse to a <very particular>
concourse of God, which would really be miraculous. But I think I have
given the true solution of that enigma.
   85. To say that God discerns what passes in the world because he is
present to the things, and not by <the dependence on him of the con-
tinuation of their existence, which may be said to involve> a continual
production of them, is saying something unintelligible. A mere pres-
ence or proximity of coexistence is not sufficient to make us understand
how that which passes in one being should answer to what passes in
another.
   86. Besides, this is exactly falling into that opinion that makes God be
the soul of the world, seeing it supposes God to perceive things, not by
their dependence on him, that is, by a continual production of what is
good and perfect in them, but by a kind of perception, such as that by
which men fancy our soul perceives what passes in the body. This is a
degrading of God's knowledge very much.
   87. ln truth and reality, this way of perception is wholly chimerical
and has no place even in human souls. They perceive what passes outside
them by what passes within them, answering to the things outside, in vir-
tue of the harmony God has pre-established by the most beautiful and
most admirable of all his productions, 105 by which every simple sub-
stance is by its nature (if one may so say) a concentration106 and a living
mirror of the whole universe according to its point of view. 107 This is
likewise one of the most beautiful and most undeniable proofs of the
existence of God, since none but God, namely, the universal cause, can
produce such a harmony of things. But God himself cannot perceive
things by the same means by which he makes other beings perceive them.
He perceives them because he is able to produce that means. And other
beings would not be caused to perceive them, if he himself did not pro-
duce them all harmonious and had not therefore in himself a representa-
tion of them-not as if that representation came from the things, but
because the things proceed from him and because he is the efficient and
exemplary cause of them. He perceives them because they proceed from
him, if one may be allowed to say that he perceives them, which ought
not to be said unless we divest that word of its imperfection, for else it
seems to signify that things act on him. They exist and are known to him
because he understands and wills them, and because what he wills is the

same as what exists. This appears so much the more because he makes
them be perceived by one another and makes them perceive one another
in consequence of the natures he has given them once for all and which
he keeps up only according to the laws of every one of them severally,
which, though different one from another, yet terminate in an exact cor-
respondence of the results of the whole. This surpasses all the ideas men
have generally framed concerning the divine perfections and the works
of God and raises [our notion of] 108 them to the highest degree, as Mr.
Bay le has acknowledged, 109 although he believed without any ground
that it exceeded possibility.
   88. To infer from that passage of Holy Scripture, in which God is said
to have rested from his works, that there is no longer a continual produc-
tion of them would be to make a very ill use of that text. lt is true that
there is no production of new simple substances, but it would be wrong to
infer from this that God is now in the world only as the soul is conceived
to be in the body, governing it merely by his presence without any con-
course being necessary to continue its existence.


To Section 31
   89. The harmony or correspondence between the soul and the body is
not a perpetual miracle, but the effect or consequence of an original mira-
de worked at the creation of things, as all natural things are. Though
indeed it is a perpetual wonder, as many natural things are.
   90. The word pre-established harmony is a term of art, I confess, but it is
not a term that explains nothing, since it is explained very intelligibly; and
the author advances nothing that shows there is any difficulty in it.
   91. The nature of every simple substance, 110 soul, or true monad being
such that its following state is a consequence of the preceding one, here
now is the cause of the harmony found out. For God needs only to make a
simple substance become once and from the beginning a representation of
the universe according to its point of view, 111 since from this alone it fol-
lows that it will be so perpetually, and that all simple substances will
always have a harmony among themselves because they always represent
the same universe.

To Section 32
    92. lt is true that according to me the soul 112 does not disturb the
laws of the body, nor the body those of the soul, and that the soul and
body do only agree together, the one acting freely according to the
rules of final causes and the other acting mechanically113 according to
the laws of efficient causes. But this does not derogate from the liberty
of our souls, as the author here will have it. For every agent who acts
according to final causes is free, although it happens to agree with an
agent acting only by efficient causes without knowledge, or mechani-
cally, because God, foreseeing what the free cause would do, did from
the beginning regulate the machine in such manner that it cannot fail
to agree with that free cause. Mr. Jaquelot 114 has very well resolved this
difficulty in one of his books against Mr. Bayle, and I have cited the
passage in my Theodicy, Part I, sec. 63. I shall speak of it again below,
no. 124.


To Section 33
   93. I do not admit that every action gives a new force to the patient. It
frequently happens in the concourse of bodies that each of them pre-
serves its force, as when two equal hard bodies meet directly. Then the
direction only is changed without any change in the force, each of the
bodies receiving the direction of the other and going back with the same
speed it came.
   94. However, I am far from saying that it is supernatural to give a
new force to a body, for I acknowledge that one body does frequently
receive a new force from another, which loses as much of its own. But I
say only that it is supernatural that the whole universe of bodies should
receive a new force, and consequently that one body should acquire any
new force without the loss of as much in others. And therefore I say like-
wise that it is an indefensible opinion to suppose the soul gives force to
the body, for then the whole universe of bodies would receive a new
force.
   95. The author's dilemma here is ill grounded, namely, that according
to me, either a man must act supernaturally or be a mere machine like a
watch. For man does not act supernaturally, and his body is truly a
machine acting only mechanically, and yet his soul is a free cause.

To Sections 34 and 35
   96. I here refer to what has been or shall be said in this letter, no. 82,
86, and 111, concerning the comparison between God and a soul of the
world, and how the opinion contrary to mine brings the one of these too
near to the other.


To Section 36
   97. I here also refer to what I have before said concerning the harmony
between the soul and the body, no. 89, etc.


To Section 37
   98. The author tells us that the soul is not in the brain but in the senso-
rium, without saying what that sensorium is. But supposing that senso-
rium to be extended, as I believe the author understands it, the same
difficulty still remains, and the question returns whether the soul is dif-
fused through that whole extension, great or small. For more or less in
size is nothing to the purpose here.


To Section 38
   99. I do not undertake here to establish my Dynamics or my doctrine of
forces; this would not be a proper place for it. However, I can very well
answer the objection here brought against me. I have affirmed that active
forces are preserved in the world 115 [without diminutions] 116• The author
objects that two soft or inelastic bodies meeting together lose some of
their force. I answer, no. lt is true that their wholes lose it with respect to
their total motion, but their parts receive it, being shaken by the force of
the concourse or shock. And therefore that loss of force is only in appear-
ance. The forces are not destroyed but scattered among the small parts.
The bodies do not lose their forces, but the case here is the same as when
men change great money into small. However, I agree that the quantity of
motion does not remain the same, and in this I approve what Sir Isaac
Newton says, p. 341 of his Optics, 117 which the author here quotes. But I
have shown elsewhere that there is a difference between the quantity of
motion and the quantity of force.

To Section 39
    100. The author maintained against me that force does naturally tessen
in the material universe, and that this arises from the dependence of
things. (Third Reply, sec. 13 and 14.) ln my third answer, 118 I asked him to
p rove that this imperfection is a consequence of the dependence of things.
He avoids answering my demand by falling upon an incident and denying
this to be an imperfection. But whether it is an imperfection or not, he
should have proved that it is a consequence of the dependence of things.
    l Ol. However, that which would make the machine of the world as
imperfect as that of an unskillful watchmaker surety must necessarily be
an imperfection.
    102. The author says now that it is a consequence of the inertia of mat-
ter. But this also he will not prove. That inertia, advanced here by him,
mentioned by Ke pier, repeated by Descartes <in his letters>, and made
use of by me in my Theodicy in order to give a notion <and at the same
time an example> of the natural im perfection of creatures, has no other
effect than to make the velocities diminish when the quantities of matter
are increased; but this is without any diminution of the forces.

To Section 40
    103. I maintained that the dependence of the machineofthe world on
its divine author is rather a reason why there can be no such imperfection
in it, and that the work of God does not need to be set right again, that it
is not liable to be disordered, and lastly that it cannot tessen in perfection.
Let anyone guess now how the author can hence infer against me, as he
does, that if this is the case, then the material world must be infinite and
etemal, without any beginning, and that God must always have created as
many men and other kinds of creatures as can possibly be created.

To Section 41
   104. I do not say that space is an order or situation which makes things
capable of being situated; this would be nonsense. Anyone needs only
consider my own words and add them to what I said above (no. 47), in
order to show how the mind comes to form to itself an idea of space, and
yet that there need not be any real and absolute being answering to that
idea distinct from the mind and from all relations. I do not say, therefore,
that space is an order or situation, but an order of situations, or (an order)
according to which situations are disposed, and that abstract space is that

Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                      61

order of situations when they are conceived as being possible. Space is
therefore something [merely] 119 ideal. But it seems the author will not
understand me. I have already answered the objection in this paper (no.
54) that order is not capable of quantity.
    105. The author objects here that time cannot be an order of successive
things because the quantity of time may become greater or less, and yet the
order of successions continues the same. I answer that this is not so. For if
the time is greater, there will be more successive and like states interposed,
and if it is less, there will be fewer, seeing there is no vacuum, nor conden-
sation, or penetration (ifl may so speak), in times any more than in places.
    106. lt is true that the immensity and eternity of God would subsist
though there were no creatures, but those attributes would have no
dependence either on times or places. If there were no creatures, there
would be neither time nor place, and consequently no actual space. The
immensity of God is independent of space as his eternity is independent
of time. These attributes signify only <with regard to these two orders of
things> that God would be present and coexistent with all the things that
should exist. And therefore I do not admit what is here advanced, that if
God existed alone, there would be time and space as there is now, whereas
then, in my opinion, they would be only in the ideas of God as mere pos-
sibili ties. The immensity and eternity of God are things more trans-
cendent than the duration and extension of creatures, not only with
respect to the greatness, but also to the nature of the things. Those divine
attributes do not imply the supposition of things extrinsic to God, such as
are actual places and times. These truths have been sufficiently acknowl-
edged by theologians and philosophers.

To Section 42
    107. I maintained that an operation of God by which he should mend
the machine of the material world, 120 tending in its nature (as this author
claims) to lose all its motion, would be a m irade. His answer was that it
would not be a miraculous operation because it would be usual and must
frequently happen. I replied that it is not usualness or unusualness that
makes a miracle properly so called, or a miracle of the highest sort, but it
is surpassing the powers of creatures, and this is the [general] 121 opinion
of theologians and philosophers; and that therefore the author acknowl-
edges at least that the thing he introduces and I disallow is, according to

119. Clarke'saddition.

the received notion, a miracle of the highest sort, that is, one which sur-
passes all created powers, and that this is the very thing which all men
endeavor to avoid in philosophy. He answers now that this is appealing
from reason to vulgar opinion. But I reply again that this vulgar opinion,
according to which we ought in philosophy to avoid as much as possible
what surpasses the natures of creatures, is a very reasonable opinion. Oth-
erwise nothing will be easier than to account for anything by bringing in
the deity, Deum ex machina, without mind ing the natures of things.
   l 08. Besides, the common opinion of theologians ought not to be
looked upon merely as vulgar opinion. A man should have weighty rea-
sons before he ventures to contradict it, and I see no such reasons here.
   109. The author seems to depart from his own notion, according to
which a miracle ought to be unusual, when, in sec. 31, he objects to me
(though without any ground) that the pre-established harmony would be
a perpetual miracle. Here I say he seems to depart from his own notion,
unless he had a mind to argue against me ad hominem.

To Section 43
    ll O. If a miracle differs from what is natural only in appearance and
with respect to us, so that we call only a miracle that which we seldom see,
there will be no internal real difference between a miracle and what is nat-
ural, and at the bottom everything will be either equally natural or equally
miraculous. Will theologians have reason to accept the former or philoso-
phers the latter?
    111. Will not this doctrine, moreover, tend to make God the soul of the
world, if all his operations are natural like those of our souls on our bod-
ies? And so God will be a part of nature.
    112. In good philosophy and sound theology we ought to distinguish
between what is explicable by the natures and powers of creatures and
what is explicable only by the powers of the infinite substance. We ought
to make an infinite difference between the operation of God, which goes
beyond the extent of natural powers, and the operations of things that fol-
low the law God has given them, and which he has enabled them to follow
by their natural powers, though not without his assistance.
    113. This overthrows attractions, 122 properly so called, and other oper-
ations inexplicable by the natural powers of creatures; those who assert
these kinds of operations must suppose them to be effected by miracles,
or else they have recourse to absurdities, that is, to the occult qualities of
the schools, which some men begin to revive under the specious name of

122. See Appendix A, no. 8.

forces, but which bring us back again into the kingdom of darkness. This
is inventa fruge, g/andibus vesci. 123
    114. ln the time of Mr. Boyle and other excellent men who flourished
in England under Charles II <in the early part of his reign>, nobody
would have ventured to publish such chimerical nations. I hope that
happy time will retum under so good a government as the present <and
that minds a little too much distracted by the misfortunes of the times
will return to cultivate sound knowledge better>. Mr. Boyle made it his
chief business to inculcate that everything was done mechanically in natu-
ral philosophy. But it is men's misfortune to grow disgusted in the end
with reason itself and to be weary of light. Chimeras begin to appear
again, and they are pleasing because they have something in them that is
wonderful. What has happened in poetry happens also in the philosophi-
cal world. People have grown weary of rational romances, such as were the
French Cte/ie or the German A ramena; 124 and they have become fond
again of the tales of fairies.
    115. As for the motions of the celestial bodies, and even the formation
of plants and animals, there is nothing in them that looks like a miracle
except their beginning. The organism of animals is a mechanism that sup-
poses a divine preformation. What follows upon it is purely natural and
entirely mechanical.
    116. Whatever is performed in the body of man and of every animal 125
is no less mechanical than what is performed in a watch. The difference is
only such as ought to be between a machine of divine invention and the
workmanship of such a limited artist as man is.

To Section 44
   117. There is no difficulty among theologians about the miracles of
angels. The question is only about the use of that word. lt may be said that
angels work miracles, but less properly so called or of an inferior order. To
dispute about this would be a mere question about a word. lt may be said
that the angel who carried Habakkuk through the air, and he who troubled
the water of the pool of Bethesda worked a miracle. But it was not a mira-
de of the highest order, for it may be explained by the natural powers of
angels, which surpass those of man.

To Section 45
    118. I objected that an attraction properly so called, or in the scholastic
sense, would be an operation at a distance without any means intervening.
The author answers here that an attraction without any means intervening
would indeed be a contradiction. Very well! But then what does he mean
when he will have the sun attract the globe of the earth through an empty
space? Is it God himself that performs it? But this would be a miracle if
ever there was any. This would surely exceed the powers of creatures.
    119. Or are perhaps some immaterial substances or some spiritual rays,
or some accident without a substance, or some kind of intentional species,
or some other I-know-not-what, the means by which this is claimed to be
performed? Of these sorts of things the author seems to have still a good
stock in his head, without explaining himself sufficiently.
    120. That means of communication (he says) is invisible, intangible,
not mechanical. He might as well have added inexplicable, unintelligible,
precarious, groundless, and unprecedented.
    121. But it is regular (the author says), it is constant, and consequently
natural. I answer that it cannot be regular without being reasonable, nor
natural unless it can be explained by the natures of creatures.
    122. If the means which causes an attraction properly so called are
constant and at the same time inexplicable by the powers of creatures, and
yet are true, it must be a perpetual miracle, and if it is not miraculous, it is
false. It is a chimerical thing, a scholastic occult quality.
    123. The case would be the same as in a body going around without
receding in the tangent, although nothing that can be explained hindered
it from receding. This is an instance I have already advanced, and the
author has not thought fit to answer it because it shows too clearly the dif-
ference between what is truly natural, on the one side, and a chimerical
occult quality of the schools, on the other.

To Section 46
    124. All the natural forces ofbodies are subject to mechanical laws, and
all the natural powers of spirits are subject to moral laws. The former fol-
low the order of efficient causes, and the latter follow the order of final
causes. The former operate without liberty, like a watch; the latter operate
with liberty, though they exactly agree with that machine which another
cause, free and superior, has adapted to them beforehand. I have already
spoken of this above, no. 92.
    125. I shall conclude with what the author objected against me at the
beginning of this Fourth Reply, to which I have already given an answer
above (no. 18, 19, 20). But I deferred speaking more fully on that matter
Leibmz's Fifth Letter                                                       65

to the conclusion of this paper. He claimed that I have been guilty of a
petition of principle. 126 But of what principle, I beseech you? Would to
God less clear principles had never been laid down. The principle in
question is the princip le of the need for a sufficient reason for anything to
exist, for any event to happen, for any truth to take place. Is this a princi-
ple that needs to be proved? The author granted it or pretended to grant
it, no. 2 of his Third Reply; possibly because the denial of it would have
appeared too unreasonable. But either he has done it only in words or he
contradicts himself or retracts his concession.
    126. I dare say that without this great principle one cannot prove the
existence of God nor account for many other important truths.
    127. Has not everybody made use of this princip le on a thousand occa-
sions? It is true that it has been neglected out of carelessness on many
occasions, but that neglect has been the true cause of chimeras, such as
are (for instance) an absolute real time or space, a vacuum, atoms, anrac-
tion in the scholastic sense, a physical influence of the soul over the body
<and of the body over the soul>, and a thousand other fictions either
derived from erroneous opinions of the ancients or lately invented by
modern philosophers.
    128. Was it not on account of Epicurus' violating this great principle
that the ancients derided his ground less declination of atoms? And I dare
say that the scholastic attraction, revived in our days and no less derided
about thirty years ago, is not at all more reasonable.
    129. I have often defied people to advance an instance against that great
princip le, to bring any one uncontested example in which it fails. But they
have never done it, nor ever will. It is certain that there is an infinite num-
ber of instances in which it succeeds, <or rather it succeeds> in all the
known cases in which it has been made use of. From this one may reason-
ably judge that it will succeed also in unknown cases or in such cases as
can only by its means become known, according to the method of experi-
mental philosophy, which proceeds a posteriori; although the princip le
was not perhaps otherwise justified by pure reason, or apriori.
    130. To deny this great principle is likewise to do as Epicurus did, who
was reduced to deny that other great principle, namely, the principle of
contradiction, which is that every intelligible enunciation must be either
true or false. Chrysippus undertook to prove that principle against Epicu-
rus, but I think I need not imitate him. I have already said what is suffi-
cient to justify mine, and I might say something more on it, but perhaps it
would be too abstruse for this present dispute. And I believe reasonable

126. That is, a begging of the question.

and impartial men will grant me that having forced an adversary to deny
that principle is reducing him ad absurdum.


Clarke's Fifth Reply127
    As multitudes of words are neither an argument of clear ideas in the
writer nor a proper means of conveying clear nations to the reader, I shall
endeavor to give a distinct answer to this Fifth Letter, as briefly as I can.
    1-20. There is no (sec. 3) similitude between a balance being moved by
weights or impulse and a mind moving itself or acting on the view of cer-
tain motives. The difference is that the one is entirely passive, which is
being subject to absolute necessity, the other not only is acted on but also
acts, which is the essence of liberty. To (sec. 14) suppose that an equal
apparent goodness in different ways of acting takes away from the mind 128
all power of acting at all, as an equality of weights keeps a balance neces-
sarily at rest, is denying the mind to have in itself a principle of action,
and is confounding the power of acting with the impression made on the
mind by the motive, in which the mind is purely passive. The motive, or
thing considered as in view, is something extrinsic to the mind. The
impression made on the mind by that motive is the perceptive quality in
which the mind is passive. The doing of anything, upon and after or in
consequence of that perception, is the power of self- motion or action,
which in all animate agents is spontaneity and in moral agents is what we
properly call liberty. Not carefully distinguishing these things, but con-
founding (sec. 15) the motive with the principle of action and denying the
mind to have any principle of action besides the motive (when indeed, in
receiving the impression of the motive, the mind is purely passive), this, I
say, is the ground of the whole error, and leads men to think that the mind
is no more active than a balance would be with the addition of a power of
perception, which is wholly taking away the very notion of liberty. A bal-
ance pushed on both sides with equal force, or pressed on both sides with
equal weights, cannot move at all; and supposing the balance endowed
with a power of perception so as to be sensible of its own incapacity to
move, or so as to deceive itself 29 with an imagination that it moves itself
when indeed it is only moved, it would be exactly in the same state in
which this learned author supposes a free agent to be in all cases of abso-
lute indifference. But the fallacy plainly lies here: the balance, for lack of
having in itself a principle or power of action, cannot move at all when the

Clarke 's Fifth Reply                                                       67

weights are equal, but a free agent, when there appear two or more per-
fectly similar reasonable ways of acting, has still within itself, by virtue of
its self-motive principle, a power of acting, and it may have very strong
and good reasons not to forbear acting at all, when yet there may be no
possible reason to determine one particular way of doing the thing to be
better than another. To affirm therefore (sec. 16-19, 69) that, supposing
two different ways of placing certain particles of matter were equally good
and reasonable, God could neither wisely nor possibly place them in
either of those ways, for lack of a sufficient weight to determine him
which way he should choose, is making God not an active but a passive
being-which is not to be a God or governor at all. And for denying the
possibility of the supposition that there may be two equal parts of matter
which may with equal fitness be transposed in situation, no other reason
can be advanced but this (sec. 20) petitio principii, that then this learned
writer's notion of a sufficient reason would not be well-grounded. For
otherwise how can any man say that it is (sec. 16, 17, 69, 66) impossible for
God to have wise and good reasons to create many particles of matter
exactly alike in different parts of the universe? In this case, the parts of
space being alike, it is evident there can be no reason, but mere will, for
not having originally transposed their situations. And yet even this cannot
be reasonably said to be a (sec. 16, 69) will without motive, for as much as
the wise reasons God may possibly have to create many particles of matter
exactly alike must consequently be a motive to him to take (what a balance
could not do) one out of two absolutely indifferents, that is, to place them
in one situation, when the transposing of them could not but have been
exactly alike good.
    Necessity, in philosophical questions, always signifies absolute neces-
sity (sec. 4-13). Hypothetical necessity 130 and moral necessity are only figu-
rative ways of speaking and, in philosophical strictness of truth, are no
necessity at all. The question is not whether a thing must be, when it is
supposed that it is or that it is to be (which is hypothetical necessity); nei-
ther is it the question whether it is true that a good being continuing to be
good cannot do evil, or a wise being continuing to be wise cannot act
unwisely, or a veracious person continuing to be veracious cannot tell a lie
(which is moral necessity). But the true and only question in philosophy
concerning liberty is whether the immediate physical cause or principle of
action is indeed in him whom we call the agent, or whether it is some
other sufficient reason, which is the real cause of the action by operating
on the agent and making him be, not indeed an agent, but a mere patient.

    lt may here be observed, by the way, that this learned author contra-
dicts his own hypothesis when he says that (sec. ll) the will does not
always precisely follow the practical understanding, because it may some-
times find reasons to suspend its resolution. For are not those very rea-
sons the last judgment of the practical understanding?
    21-25. If it is possible for God to make or to have made two pieces of
matter exactly alike, so that transposing them in situation would be per-
fectly indifferent, this leamed author's notion of a sufficient reason falls
to the ground. To this he answers not (as his argument requires) that it is
impossible for God to make two pieces exactly alike, 131 but that it is not
wise for him to do so. But how does he know that it would not be wise for
God to do so? Can he prove that it is not possible that God may have wise
reasons for creating many parts of matter exactly alike in different parts of
the universe? The only argument he advances is that then there would not
be a sufficient reason to determine the will of God as to which piece
should be placed in which situation. But if, in case anything else should
appear to the contrary, God may possibly have many wise reasons for cre-
ating many pieces exactly alike, will the indifference alone of the situation
of such pieces make it impossible that he should create or impossible that
it should be wise in him to create them? I humbly conceive that this is an
(sec. 20) express begging of the question. To the like argument drawn by
me from the absolute indifference of the original particular determination
of motion, no answer has been returned.
    26-32. ln these articles there seem to be contained many contradic-
tions. lt is allowed (sec. 26) that two things exactly alike would really be
two, and yet it is still ad duced that they would need the princip/e of indi-
viduation, and in the Fourth Letter, sec. 6, it was expressly affirmed that
they would be only the same thing under two names. A (sec. 26) supposi-
tion is allowed to be possible, and yet l must not be allowed to make the
supposition. The (sec. 27) parts of time and space are allowed to be exactly
alike in themselves, but not so when bodies exist in them. Different coex-
istent parts of space and different successive parts of time are (sec. 28)
compared to a straight line cutting another straight line in two coincident
points, which are but one point only. It is affirmed that (sec. 29) space is
nothing but the order of things coexisting, and yet it is (sec. 30) confessed
that the material universe may possibly be finite, in which case there must
necessarily be an empty extramundane space. It is (sec. 30, 8, 73) allowed
that God could make the material universe finite, and yet supposing it to
be possibly finite is called not only a unreasonable supposition, void of
design, but also an (sec. 29) impracticable fiction, and it is affirmed that

Clarke 's Fifth Reply                                                             69

there can be no possible reason which can limit the quantity of matter. 132
lt is affirmed that the motion of the material universe would produce (sec.
29) no change at all, and yet no answer is given to the argument I
advanced that a sudden increase or stoppage of the motion of the whole
would give a sensible shock to all the parts, and it is as evident that a cir-
cular motion of the whole 133 would produce a vis centrifuga134 in all the
parts. My argument that the material world must be movable, if the whole
is finite, is (sec. 31) denied because the parts of space are immovable, of
which the whole is infinite and necessarily existing. lt is affirmed that
motion necessarily implies a (sec. 31) relative change of situation in one
body with regard to other bodies, and yet no way is shown to avoid this
absurd consequence that then the mobility of one body depends on the
existence of other bodies, and that any single body existing alone would be
incapable of motion, or that the parts of a circulating body (suppose the
sun) would lose the vis centrifUga arising from their circular motion, if all
the extrinsic matter around them was annihilated. Lastly, it is affirmed
that the (sec. 32) infinity of matter is an effect of the will of God, and yet
Descartes' notion is (ibid.) approved as irrefutable; the only foundation of
this all men know to have been the supposition that matter was infinite
necessarily in the nature of things, since it is a contradiction to suppose it
finite. His words are "Puto implicare contradictionem, ut mundus fini-
rus,'' 135 which, if it is true, it never was in the power of God to determine
the quantity of matter, and consequently he neither was the creator of it
nor can destroy it.
    And indeed there seems to run a continua] inconsistency through the
whole of what this leamed author writes concerning matter and space. For
sometimes he argues against a vacuum (or space void of matter) as if it was
(sec. 29, 33-5, 62-3) absolutely impossible in the nature of things, space
and matter being (sec. 62) inseparable, and yet frequently he allows the
quantity of matter in the universe to depend upon the (sec. 30, 32, 73) will
of God.
    33-35. To the argument drawn against a plenum of matter from the
lack of resistance in certain spaces, this learned author answers that those
spaces are filled with a matter which has no (sec. 35) gravity. But the argu-
ment was not drawn from gravity, but from resistance, which must be

proportional to the quantity of matter, whether the matter had any gravity
or not. 136
    To obviate this reply, he claims that (sec. 34) resistance does not arise
so much from the quantity of matter as from its difficulty of giving place.
But this allegation is wholly wide of the purpose, because the question
related only to such fluid bodies which have little or no tenacity, as water
and quicksilver whose parts have no other difficulty of giving place but
what arises from the quantity of the matter they contain. The instance of a
(ibid.) floating piece of wood containing less of heavy matter than an equal
bulk of water, and yet making greater resistance, is wonderfully unphilo-
sophical, for an equal bulk of water shut up in a vessel, or frozen into ice
and floating, makes a greater resistance than the floating wood, the resis-
tance then arising from the whole bulk of the water; but when the water is
loose and at liberty in its state of fluidity, the resistance is then not made
by the whole, but by part only of the equal bulk of water, and then it is no
wonder that it seems to make less resistance than the wood.
    36-48. These paragraphs do not seem to contain serious arguments,
but only represent in an ill light the notion of the immensity or omnipres-
ence of God, who is not a mere intelligentia supramundana (semota a nos-
tris rebus sejunctaque longe), 137 and who "is not far from everyone of us,
for in him we" (and all things) "live and move and have our being." 138
    The space occupied by a body is not the (sec. 36, 37) extension of the
body, but the extended body exists in that space.
    There is no such thing in reality as (sec. 38) bounded space, but only
we in our imagination fix our attention on what part or quantity we please
of that which itself is always and necessarily unbounded.
    Space is not an (sec. 39) affection of one body or of another body or of
any finite being, nor passes from subject to subject, but is always invari-
ably the immensity of one only and always the same immensum.
    Finite spaces are not at all the (sec. 40) affections of finite substances,
but they are only those parts of infinite space in which finite substances
exist.
    If matter was infinite, still infinite space would no more be an (sec. 41)
affect ion of that infinite body than finite spaces are the affections of finite
bodies, but in that case the infinite matter would be, as finite bodies now
are, in the infinite space.
    lmmensity as well as eternity is (sec. 42) essential to God. The parts of

immensity 139 (being totally of a different kind from corporeal, partable,
separable, divisible, movable parts, which are the ground of corruptibil-
ity) do no more hinder immensity from being essentially one than the
parts of duration hinder eternity from being essentially one.
   God himself suffers no (sec. 43) change at all by the variety and
changeableness of things which live and move and have their being in
him.
   This (sec. 44) strange doctrine is the express assertion of Saint Paul140
as well as the p bin voice of nature and reason.
   God does not exist (sec. 45) in space and in time, but his existence141
causes space and time. And when, according to the analogy of vulgar
speech, we say that he exists in all space and in all time, the words mean
only that he is omnipresent and eternal, that is, that boundless space and
time are necessary consequences of his existence, and not that space and
time are beings distinct from him and in which he exists.

shown just above, in sec. 40. And the two following sections also (sec. 47

142. Clarke notes: The principa! occasion or reason ofthe confusion and inconsis-
tencies, which appear in what most writers have advanced concerning the nature
of space, seems to be that (unless they attend carefully) men are very apt to neglect
that necessary distinction (without which there can be no clear reasoning) which
ought always to be made between abstracts and concretes, such as are immensitas
and immensum, and also between ideas and things, such as are the notion (which is
within our own mind) of immensity and the real immensity actually existing out-
side us.
        All the conceptions (l think) that ever have been or can be framed concern-
ing space are these which follow: That it is either absolutely nothing or a mere idea
or only a relation of one thing to another, or it is body or some other substance, or
else a property of a substance
        That it is not absolutely nothing is most evident. For of nothing there is no
quantity no dimensions no properties. This principle is the first foundation of all
science whatsoever, expressing the only difference between what does and what
does not exist.
        That it is not a mere idea is likewise most manifest. For no idea of space can
possibly be framed larger than fmite, and yet reason demonstrates that it is a con-
tradiction for space itself not to be actually infinite.
        That it is not a bare relation of one thing to another, arising from their sit-
uation or order among themselves, is no less apparent, because space is a quantity,
which relations (such as situation and order) are not, as I have largely shown below,
72                                                                   The Correspondence

and 48) need only to be compared with what has been already (see also
below, sec. 53 and 54) said.
    49-51. These seem to me to be only a quibbling with words. Concern-
ing the question about space having parts, see above, Third Reply, sec. 3,
and Fourth Reply, sec. ll.
    52 and 53. My argument here for the notion of space being really inde-
pendent of body is founded on the possibility of the material universe
being finite and movable; it is not enough therefore for this learned writer
to reply that he thinks it would not have been wise and reasonable for God
to have made the material universe finite and movable. He must either
affirm that it was impossible for God to make the material world finite and
movable, or else he must of necessity allow the strength of my argument
drawn from the possibility of the world's being finite and movable. Nei-
ther is it sufficient barely to repeat his assertion that the motion of a finite
material universe would be nothing and (for lack of other bodies to com-
pare it with) would (sec. 52) produce no discoverable change, unless he
could disprove the instance I gave of a very great change that would hap-
pen, namely, that the parts would be sensibly shocked by a sudden accel-
eration or stop ping of the motion of the whole--to which instance he has
not attempted to give any answer.
    53. Whether this learned author's being forced here to acknowledge
the difference between absolute real motion and relative motion does not
necessarily infer that space is really a quite different thing from the situa-
tion or order of bodies, I leave to the judgment of those who shall be
pleased to compare what this learned writer here advances with what Sir
Isaac Newton has said in his Principia I, definition 8. 143
    54. I had adduced that time and space were quantities, which situation
and order were not. To this it is replied that order has its quantity, there is
that which goes before and that which follows, there is distance or interval

in sec. 54. Also because, ifthe material universe is or can possibly be fmite, there
cannot but be actual or possible extramundane space; see in sec. 31, 52, and 73.
        That space is not body is also most clear. For then body would be necessar-
ily infinite and no space could be void of resistance to motion. This is contrary to
expenence.
        That space is not any kind of substance is no less plain, because infinite
space is immensitas, not immensum, whereas infinite substance is immensum not im-
mensitas-just as duration is not a substance, because infinite duration is aetemitas
not aeternum, but infmite substance is aeternum not aetemitas.
        It remains therefore, by necessary consequence, that space is a property, in
like manner as duration is. lmmensitas is -rovimmensi, just as aeternitas is -rov aeterni.

I answer that going before and following constitutes situation or order, but
the distance, interval, or quantity of time or space, in which one thing fol-
lows another, is entirely a distinct thing from the situation or order and
does not constitute any quantity of situation or order; the situation or
order may be the same when the quantity of time or space intervening is
very different. This learned author further replies that ratios or propor-
tions (sec. 54) have their quantity, and therefore so may time and space,
though they are nothing but relations. I answer first that if it had been true
that some particular sorts of relations, such as ratios or proportions were
quantities, still it would not have followed that situation and order, which
are relations of a quite different kind, would have been quantities too. But
secondly, proportions are not quantities but the proportions of quantities.
If they were quantities, they would be the quantities of quantities, which is
absurd. Also, if they were quantities, they would (like all other quantities)
always increase by addition, but the addition of the proportion of l to l to
the proportion of l to l still makes no more than the proportion of l to l,
and the addition of the proportion of half to l to the proportion of l to l
does not make the proportion of l and a half to l, but the proportion only
of half to l. That which mathematicians sometimes inaccurately call the
quantity of proportion is (accurately and strictly speaking) only the quan-
tity of the relative or comparative magnitude of one thing with regard to
another, and proportion is not the comparative magnitude itself, but the
comparison or relation of the magnitude to another. The proportion of 6 to
l, with regard to that of 3 to l, is not a double quantity of proportion, but
the proportion of a double quantity. And, in general, what they call bearing
a greater or less proportion is not bearing a greater or less quantity of pro-
portion or relation, but bearing the proportion or relation of a greater or
less quantity to another; it is not a greater or less quantity of comparison,
but the comparison of a greater or less quantity. The (sec. 54) logarithmic
expression of a proportion is not (as this !earned author calls it) a measure,
but only an artificial index or sign of proportion; it is not the expressing a
quantity of proportion, but barely a denoting the number of times that any
proportion is repeated or complicated. The logarithm of the proportion of
equality is Oand yet it is as real and as much a proportion as any other, and
when the logarithm is negative, as T, yet the proportion of which it is the
sign or index is itself affirmative. Duplicate or triplicate proportion does
not denote a double or triple quantity of proportion, but the number of
times that the proportion is repeated. The tripling of any magnitude or
quantity once produces a magnitude or quantity, which to the former bears
the proportion of3 to l . The tripling it a second time produces (not a dou-
ble quantity of proportion but) a magnitude or quantity, which to the
former bears the proportion (called duplicate) of 9 to l. The tripling it a
74                                                        The Correspondence

third time produces (not a triple quantity of proportion but) a magnitude
or quantity, which to the former bears the proportion (called triplicate) of
27 to l, and so on. Thirdly, time and space are not of the nature of propor-
tions at all, but of the nature of absolute quantities to which proportions
belong. As for example, the proportion of 12 to l is a much greater propor-
tion (that is, as I now observed, not a greater quantity of proportion, but
the proportion of a greater comparative quantity) than that of 2 to l, and
yet one and the same unvaried quantity may to one thing bear the propor-
tion of 12 to l and to another thing at the same time the proportion of 2 to
l. Thus the space of a day bears a much greater proportion to an hour than
it does to half a day, and yet it remains, notwithstanding both the propor-
tions, the same unvaried quantity of time. Time therefore (and space like-
wise by the same argument) is not of the nature of a proportion, but of an
absolute and unvaried quantity to which different proportions belong.
Unless this reasoning can be shown to be false, our leamed author's opin-
ion still remains by his own confession144 a contradiction.
    55-63. All this seems to me to be a plain contradiction, and I am will-
ing to leave it to the judgment of the learned. ln one paragraph (sec. 56)
there is a plain and distinct supposition that the universe might be created
as much sooner or later as God pleased. ln the rest (sec. 55, 57-63) the
very terms (sooner or later) are treated as unintelligible terms and impos-
sible suppositions. 145 Similar things occur concerning the space in which
matter subsists; see above, in sec. 26-32.
    64 and 65. See above, in sec. 54.
    66--70. See above, in sec. 1-20 and in sec. 21-25. I shall here only add
that (sec. 70) comparing the will of God when it chooses one out of many
equally good ways of acting to Epicurus' chance, who allowed no will no
intelligence no active princip le at all in the formation of the universe, is
comparing together two things than which no two things can possibly be
more different.

    73-75. In the consideration whether space is independent of matter
and whether the material universe can be finite and movable (see above, in
sec. 120, and in 26-32), the question is not concerning the wisdom or
(sec. 73) will of God, but concerning the absolute and necessary nature of
things. If the material universe can possibly be finite and movable by the
will of God (which this leamed author here finds himself necessitated to
grant, though he perpetually treats it as an impossible supposition), then

space (in which that motion is performed) is manifestly independent of
matter. But if, on the contrary, the material universe cannot be finite and
movable 146 and space cannot be independent of matter, then (l say) it fol-
lows evidently that God neither can nor ever could set bounds to matter,
and consequently the material universe must be not only boundless, but
(sec. 74) eternal also, both a parte ante and a parte post, 147 necessarily and
independently of the will of God. For the opinion of those who contend
that the world (sec. 75) might possibly be eternal by the will of God exer-
cising his eternal power, this has no relation at all to the matter at present
in question.

    79-82. All that is objected in the (sec. 79, 80) two former of these para-
graphs is a mere quibbling with words. The existence of God (as has often
been already observed) causes space, and in that space all other things
exist. lt is therefore (sec. 80) the place of ideas likewise, because it is the
place of the substances themselves in whose understandings ideas exist.
    The soul of man being (sec. 81) the soul of the images of the things it
perceives was advanced by me, in way of comparison, as an instance of a
ridiculous notion, and this learned writer pleasantly argues against it as if
I had affirmed it to be my own opinion.
    God perceives everything, not (sec. 82) by means of any organ, but by
being himself actually present everywhere. This everywhere therefore, or
universal space, is the place of his perception. The notion of sensorium and
of the soul of the world has been abundantly explained before. It is too
much to desire to have the conclusion given up without bringing any fur-
ther objection against the premises.
    83-88, and 89-91. That (sec. 83) the soul is a representative principle,
that (sec. 87) every simple substance is by its nature a concentration and
living mirror of the whole universe, 148 that (sec. 91) it is a representation
of the universe according to its point of view, 149 and that all simple sub-
stances will always have a harmony between themselves because they
always represent the same universe, all this, I acknowledge, I understand
not at all.

    92. To suppose that all the motions of our bodies are necessary and
caused entirely (sec. 92, 95, 116) by mere mechanical impulses of mat-
ter152 altogether independent on the soul is what (l cannot but think)
tends to introduce necessity and fate. lt tends to make men be thought as
mere machines, as Descartes imagined beasts to be, by taking away all
arguments drawn from phenomena, 153 that is, from the actions of men, to
prove that there is any soul, or anything more than mere matter in men at
all. See below, in sec. 110--116.
    93-95. I adduced that every action is the giving of a new force to the
thing acted upon. To this it is objected that two equal hard bodies striking
each other retum with the same force, and that therefore their action on
each other gives no new force. It might be sufficient to reply that the bod-
ies do neither of them return with their own force, but each of them loses
its own force and each returns with a new force impressed by the other's
elasticity, for if they are not elastic, they do not return at all. But indeed,
all mere mechanical communications of motion are not properly action,
but mere passiveness, both in the bodies that impel and that are impelled.
Action is the beginning of a motion where there was none before from a
princip le of life or activity, and if God or man or any living or active power
ever influences anything in the material world, and everything is not mere
absolute mechanism, there must be a continual increase and decrease of

the whole quantity of motion in the universe--which this learned gentle-
man 154 frequently denies.


l 54. Clarke notes: There appears a great confusion and inconsistency in Mr. Leib-
niz's whole notion of this matter. For the wordforce, and active force, signifies in
the present question the impetus or relative impulsive force ofbodies in motion;
see my Third Reply, sec. 13. Mr. Leibniz constantly uses the word in this sense, as
when he speaks (sec. 93, 94, 99, and 107 ofthis last answer) of bodies not changing
their force after reflection because they return with the same speed; of a body's re-
ceiving a new force from another body which lo ses as much of its own; of the im-
possibility that one body should acquire any new force without the loss of as much
in others; of the new force which the whole material universe would receive, if the
soul of man communicated any force to the body; and of active forces continuing
always the same in the universe because the force which inelastic bodies lose in
their whole is communicated to and dispersed among their small parts. Now this
impetus, or relative impulsive active force of bodies in motion, is evidently both in
reason and experience always proportional to the quantity of motion. Therefore,
according to Mr. Leibniz's principles, since this impulsive active force is always
the same in quantity, the quantity of motion also must of necessity always be the
same in the universe. Yet elsewhere he consistently acknowledges (sec. 99) that the
quantity of motion is not always the same, and in the Acta Eruditorum of 1686, p.
161 [GM VI, 117-9], he endeavors to prove that the quantity of motion in the uni-
verse is not always the same, from that very argument, and from that single argu-
ment only (of the quantity of impulsive force being always the same) which, if it
was true, would necessarily infer, on the contrary, that the quantity of motion
could not but always be the same. The reason of his inconsistency in this matter
was his computing, by a wonderfully unphilosophical error, the quantity of imput-
sive force in an ascending body from the quantity of its matter and of the space de-
scribed by it in ascending, without considering the time of its ascending.
        He says (Acta Erudatorum, 1686, p. 162): "l suppose the same force is required
to raise a body A of one pound weight to the height of four yards which will raise the
body B of four pounds weight to the height of one yard. This is granted both by the
Cartesians and other philosophers and mathematicians of our times. And from this
it follows that the body A, by falling from the height of four yard s, acquires exactly
the same force as the body B, by falling from the height of one yard."
        But in this supposition Mr. Leibniz is greatly mistaken. Neither the Carte-
sians nor any other philosophers or mathematicians ever grant this, except in such
cases only where the times of ascent or descent are equal. If a pendu1um osci11ates
in a cycloid, the arch of the cycloid described in ascend ing will be as the force with
which the pendulous body begins to ascend from the lowest point, because the
times of ascending are equal. And if equal bodies librate upon the arm of a balance
at various distances from the axis of the balance, the forces of the bodies will be in
proportion as the arcs described by them in librating, because they librate in the
same time. And if two equal globes lying upon an horizontal plane are impelled by
unequal forces, they will in equal times describe spaces proportional to the forces
78                                                                 The Correspondence


impelling them. Or if unequal globes are impelled with equal forces, they will in
equal times describe spaces reciprocally proportional to their masses. And in all these
cases, if equal bodies are impelled by unequal forces, the forces impressed, the ve-
locities generated, and the spaces described in equal times will be proportional to one
another. And if the bodies are unequal, the velocity of the bigger bodies will be so
much less as the bodies are bigger, and therefore the motion (arising from the mass
and velocity together) will be in all these cases, and in all other cases consequently,
proportional to the force impressed. (From this, by the way, it plainly follows that if
there is always the same impulsive force in the world, as Mr. Leibniz affirms, there
must be always the same motion in the world, contrary to what he affrrms.)
         But Mr. Leibniz confounds the cases where the times are equal with the
cases where the times are unequal, and chiefly that of bodies rising and falling at
the ends of the unequal arms of a balance (Acta Eruditorum, 1686, p. 162; 1690, p.
234; 1691, p. 439; 1695, p. 155 [GM VI, 117-9; 193--203, 204-11, 234]) is con-
founded by him with that of bodies falling downwards and thrown upwards with-
out allowing for the ine quality of the time. For a body with one and the same force
and one and the same velocity will in a longer time describe a greater space, and
therefore the time is to be considered and the forces are not to be reckoned propor-
tional to the spaces, unless where the times are equal. Where the times are unequal,
the forces of equal bodies are as the spaces applied to the times. And in this the
Cartesians and other philosophers and mathematicians agree, all of them making
the impulsive forces of bodies proportional to their motions, and measuring their
motions by their masses and velocities together, and their velocities by the spaces
which they describe, applied to the times in which they describe them. If a body
thrown upwards does, by doubling its velocity, ascend four times higher in twice
the time, its impulsive force will be increased, not in the proportion of the space
described by its ascent, but in the proportion of that space applied to the time, that
is, in the proportion of 4/2 to 111 or 2 to l. For if, in this case, the force should be
increased in the proportion of 4 to l, and, in oscillating in a cycloid, the same body
with the same velocity dou bled describes only a doubled arc, and its force is there-
fore only doubled, this body, with one and the same degree of velocity, would have
twice as much force when thrown upwards as when thrown horizontally-which
is a plain contradiction. And there is the same contradiction in affirming that al-
though a body at the end of the unequal arms of a balance, by doubling its velocity,
acquires only a double impulsive force, yet, by being thrown upwards with the
same doubled velocity, it acquires a quadruple impulsive force-in this assertion,
I say, there is the same contradiction, for equal bodies with equal velocities cannot
have unequal impulsive forces.
         On the supposition of gravity being uniform, Galileo demonstrated the mo-
tion of projectiles in mediums void of resistance, and his propositions are allowed
by all mathematicians, not excepting Mr. Leibniz himself. Now, supposing the
time of a falling body to be divided into equal parts, since gravity is uniform, and,
by being so, acts equally in equal parts of time, it must by its action impress and
communicate to the falling body equal impulsive forces, velocities, and mot ions, in
equal times. And therefore the impulsive force, the velocity, and the motion of the
Clarke 's Fifth Reply                                                                  79


falling body will increase in proportion to the time of falling. But the space de-
scribed by the falling body arises partly from the velocity of the body and partly
from the time of its falling, and so is in a compound ratio of them both, or as the
square of either of them, and consequently as the square of the impulsive force.
And by the same way of arguing, it may be proved that when a body is thrown up-
wards with any impulsive force, the height to which it will ascend will be as the
square of that force, and that the force required to make the body B of four pounds
weight rise up one yard will make the body A of one pound weight rise up (not four
yards, as Mr. Leibniz represents, but) sixteen yards, in quadruple the time. For the
gravity of four pounds weight in one part of time acts as much as the gravity of one
pound weight in four parts of time.
        Bu t Mr. Herman, in his Phoronomia [Amsterdam, 1716], p. 113 (arguing for
Mr. Leibniz against those who hold that the forces acquired by falling bodies are
proportional to the times of falling, or to the velocities acquired) represents that
this is founded upon a false supposition: that bodies thrown upwards receive from
the gravity which resists them an equal number of impulse s in equal times. This is
as much as to say that gravity is not uniform and, by consequence, to overthrow
the theory of Galileo concerning projectiles, allowed by all geometers. I suppose
that he means that the swifter the motion ofbodies is upward s, the more numerous
are the impulses, because the bodies meet the (imaginary) gravitating particles.
And thus the weight of bodies will be greater when they move upwards and less
when they move downwards. And yet Mr. Leibniz and Mr. Herman themselves
allow that gravity in equal times generates equal velocities in descending bodies
and takes away equal velocities in ascending bodies, and therefore is uniform. ln
its action upon bodies for generating velocity, they allow it to be uniform, in its ac-
tion upon them for generating impulsive force, they deny it to be uniform, and so
are inconsistent with themselves.
         If the force acquired by a body in falling is as the space described, let the
time be divided into equal parts, and if in the first part of time it gain one part of
force, in the two first parts of time it will gain four parts of force, in the three first
parts of time it will gain nine parts of force, and so on. And by consequence, in the
second part oftime it will gain three parts of force, in the third part of time it will
gain five parts of force, in the fourth part of time it will gain seven parts of force,
and so on. And therefore if the action of gravity for generating these forces is sup-
posed, in the middle of the first part of time, to be of one degree, it will, in the mid-
dle of the second, third, and fourth parts of time, be of three, five, and seven
degrees, and so on; that is, it will be proportional to the time and to the velocity
acquired, and, by consequence, in the beginning of the time it will be none at all,
and so the body, for lack of gravity, will not fall down. And by the same way of ar-
guing, when a body is thrown upward s, its gravity will decrease as its velocity de-
creases and cease when the body ceases to ascend, and then for lack of gravity, it
will rest in the air and fall down no more. So full of absurdities is the notion of this
learn ed author in this particular.
        To decide this question demonstratively, let two pendulous globes ofhard-
ened steel be suspended by equal radii or threads of equal length, so that when they
80                                                                 The Correspondence

    96 and 97. Here this learned author refers only to what he has said
elsewhere, and I am also willing to do the same.
    98. If the soul is a substance that fills the sensorium or place in which it
perceives the images of things conveyed to it, still it does not follow from
this that it must consist of corporeal parts (for the parts of body are dis-
tinct substances independent of each other), but the whole soul sees, and
the whole hears and the whole thinks, as being essentially one individual.
    99. ln order to show that the active forces in the world 155 (meaning the
quantity of motion 156 or impulsive force given to bodies) do not naturally
diminish, this learned writer urges that two soft inelastic bodies meeting
together with equal and contrary forces do for this only reason lose each
of them the motion of their whole, because it is communicated and dis-
persed into a motion of their small parts. But the question is, when two
perfectly hard inelastic bodies lose their whole motion by meeting
together, what then becomes of the motion or active impulsive force? lt
cannot be dispersed among the parts, because the parts are capable of no
tremulous motion for lack of elasticity. And if it is denied that the bodies
would lose the motion of their wholes, I answer, then it would follow that
elastic hard bodies would reflect with a double force, namely, the force
arising from the elasticity, and moreover all (or at least part of) the origi-
nal direct force-which is contrary to experience.
    At length (upon the demonstration I cited from Sir Isaac Newton), he
is obliged to (sec. 99) allow that the quantity of motion in the world is not
always the same, and goes to another refuge, that motion and force are
not always the same in quantity. But this is also contrary to experience.
For the force here spoken of is not the vis inertiae 157 of matter (which

hang down and touch each other the radii or threads may be parallel. Let one of
the globes be constantly the same and be drawn aside from the other to one and the
same distance in all the subsequent trials. Let the other be of any size and be drawn
aside the contrary way to a distance reciprocally proportional to its weight. Let
both of them then be let go at one and the same moment of time, so that they may
meet each other at the lowest place of their descent, where they hun g before they
were drawn aside; and the first globe will always rebound alike from the other. For
this reason the force of the other is always the same when its velocity is reciprocally
proportional to its weight. And by consequence, if its weight remains the same, its
force will be proportional to its velocity. Q E. D.

157. Clarke notes: The vis inertiae of matter is that passive force by which it always
continues of itself in the state it is in and never changes that state but in proportion
to a contrary power acting upon it. lt is that passive force not by which (as Mr.
Clarke 's Fifth Reply                                                              81

continues indeed always the same, as long as the quantity of matter con-
tinues the same), but the force meant here is relative active impulsive
force, which is always proportional to the quantity of relative motion, 158
as is constantly evident in experience, except where some error has been
committed in not rightly computing and subducting the contrary or
impeding force, which arises from the resistance of fluids to bodies
moved any way and from the continual contrary action of gravitation on
bodies thrown upwards.
    100-102. That active force, 159 in the sense defined above, does natu-
rally diminish continually in the material universe has been shown in the
last paragraph. That this is no defect is evident because it is only a con-
sequence of matter being lifeless, void of motivity, inactive and inert. For
the inertia of matter causes not only (as this learned author observes)
that velocity decreases in proportion as quantity of matter increases
(which is indeed no decrease of the quantity of motion), but also that
solid and perfectly hard bodies, void of elasticity, meeting together with
equal and contrary forces, lose their whole motion and active force (as
has been shown above), and must depend on some other cause for new
motion.
    103. That none of the things here referred to are defects I have largely
shown in my former papers. For why was not God at liberty to make a
world that should continue in its present form as long or as short a time as
he thought fit, and should then be altered (by such changes as may be very
wise and fit and yet impossible perhaps to be performed by mechanism)
into whatever other form he himself pleased? Whether my inference from

Leibniz understands it from Kepler) matter resists motion, but by which it equally
resists any change from the state it is in, either of rest or motion, so that the very
same force, which is required to give any certain velocity to any certain quantity of
matter at rest, is always exactly required to reduce the same quantity of matter
from the same degree of velocity to a state of rest again. This vis inertiae is always
proportional to the quantity of matter, and therefore continues invariably the same
in all possible states of matter, whether at rest or in motion, and is never trans-
ferred from one body to another. Without this vis, the least force would give any
velocity to the greatest quantity of matter at rest, and the greatest quantity of mat-
ter in any velocity of motion would be stopped by the least force without any the
least shock at all. So that properly and indeed all force in matter, either at rest or
in motion, all its action and reaction, all impulse and all resistance, is nothing but
this vis inertiae in different circumstances
158. Clarke notes: That is, proportional to the quantity of matter and the velocity,
not (as Mr. Leibniz affirms,Acta Eruditorum 1695, p. 156) to the quantity of matter
and the square of the velocity. See above, the footnote to sec. 93-5.

this learned author's affirming160 that the universe cannot diminish in per-
fection, that there is no possible reason which can limit the quantity of
matter, that God's perfections oblige him to produce always as much mat-
ter as he can, and that a finite material universe is an impracticable fic-
tion, 161 whether (I say) my inferring that (according to these notions) the
world must necessarily have been both infinite and eternal is a just infer-
ence or not, I am willing to leave to the learned, who shall compare the
papers, to judge.
    104-106. We are now told that (sec. 104) space is not an order or situa-
tion but an order of situations. But still the objection remains that an
order of situations is not quantity as space is. He refers therefore to sec.
54, where he thinks he has proved that order is a quantity, and I refer to
what I have said above in this paper, in that section where I think I have
proved that it is not a quantity. What he adduces concerning (sec. 105)
time likewise amounts plainly to the following absurdity: that time is only
the order of things successive and yet is truly a quantity, because it is not
only the order of things successive but also the quantity of duration inter-
vening between each of the particulars succeeding in that order. This is an
express contradiction.
    To say that (sec. 106) immensity does not signify boundless space, and
that eternity does not signify duration or time without beginning and end,
is (I think) affirming that words have no meaning. Instead of reasoning on
this point, we are referred to what certain theologians and philosophers
(that is, such as were of this learned author's opinion) have acknowledged,
which is not the matter in question.
    107-109. I affirmed that, with regard to God, no one possible thing is
more miraculous than another, and that therefore a miracle does not con-
sist in any difficulty in the nature of the thing to be done, but merely in
the unusualness of God's doing it. The terms nature, and powers ofnature,
and course ofnature, and the like, are nothing but empty words and signify
merely that a thing usually or frequently comes to pass. The raising of a
human body out of the dust of the earth we call a miracle, the generation
of a human body in the ordinary way we call natural, for no other reason
but because the power of God effects one usually, the other unusually.
The sudden stopping of the sun (or earth) we call a miracle, the continual
motion of the sun (or earth) we call natural, for the very same reason only
of the one's being usual and the other unusual. If man did usually arise
out of the grave as corn grows out of seed sown, we should certainly call
that also natural, and if the sun (or earth) did constantly stand still, we

should then think that to be natural and its motion at any time would be
miraculous. Against these evident reasons (ces (sec. 108) grandes raisons)
this learned writer offers nothing at all, but continues barely to refer us to
the vulgar forms of speaking of certain philosophers and theologians,
which (as I before observed) is not the matter in question.
    110-116. lt is here very surprising that, in a point of reason and not of
authority, we are still again (sec. 110) remitted to the opinions of certain
philosophers and theologians. But to omit this, what does this learned
writer mean by a (sec. 110) real internal diffirence between what is miracu-
lous and not miraculous, or between (sec. Ill) operations natural and not
natural, absolutely and with regard to God? Does he think there are in
God two different and really distinct principles or powers of acting and
that one thing is more difficult to God than another? If not, then either a
natural and a supernatural action of God are terms whose signification is
only relative to us, we calling an usual effect of God's power natural and
an unusual one supernatural, the (sec. 112) force of nature being, in truth,
nothing but an empty word, or else by the one must be meant that which
God does immediately himself, and by the other that which he does medi-
ately by the instrumentality of second causes. The former of these distinc-
tions is what this leamed author is here professedly opposing, the latter is
what he expressly disclaims (sec. 117), where he allows that angels may
work true miracles. And yet besides these two, I think no other distinction
can possibly be imagined.
   lt is very unreasonable to call (sec. 113) attraction a miracle and an
unphilosophical term, after it has been so often distinctly declared 162 that
by that term we do not mean to express the cause of bodies tending
toward each other, but barely the effect or the phenomenon itself, and the
laws or proportions of that tendency discovered by experience, whatever
is or is not the cause of it. And it seems still more unreasonable not to

162. Clarke quotes the following passages in Newton, in which he denies that
gravity is regarded as an occult quality:
        "How these attractions may be performed, I do not here consider. What I
call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to
me. I use that word here to signify only, in general, any force by which bodies tend
toward one another, whatever may be the cause. For we must learn from the phe-
nomena of nature what bodies attract one another and what are the laws and prop-
erties of that attraction before we inquire into the cause by which the attraction is
performed." Optics, beginning of Query 31.

admit gravitation or attraction in this sense, in which it is manifestly an
actual phenomenon of nature, and yet at the same time to expect that
there should be admitted so strange an hypothesis as the (sec. 109, 92, 87,
89, 90) harmonia praestabilita, which is that the soul and body of a man
have no more influence on each other's motions and affections than two
clocks, 163 which, at the greatest distance from each other, go alike without
at all affecting each other. It is adduced indeed that God (sec. 92), foresee-
ing the inclinations of every man's soul, so contrived at first the great
machine of the material universe as that, by the mere necessary laws of
mechanism, suitable motions should be excited in human bodies as parts
of that great machine. But is it possible that such kinds of motion, 164 and
of such variety as those in human bodies are, should be performed by
mere mechanism, without any influence of will and mind on them? Or is
it credible that when a man has it in his power to resolve and know a
month beforehand what he will do on such a particular day or hour to
come, is it credible, I say, that his body shall by the mere power of mecha-
nism, impressed originally on the material universe at its creation,
punctually conform itself to the resolutions of the man' s mind at the time
appointed? According to this hypothesis, all arguments in philosophy
taken from phenomena and experiments are at an end. For if the harmonia
praestabilita 165 is true, a man does not indeed see, nor hear, nor feel any-
thing, nor moves his body, but only dreams that he sees and hears and
feels and moves his body. 166 And if the world can once be persuaded that a
man's body is a mere machine, and that all his seemingly voluntary
motions are performed by the mere necessary laws of corporeal mecha-
nism, without any influence, or operation, or action at all of the soul on
the body, they will soon conclude that this machine is the whole man, and
that the soul in harmony in the hypothesis of a harmonia praestabilita is
merely a fiction and a dream. Besides, what difficulty is there avoided by
so strange a hypothesis? This only: that it cannot be conceived (it seems)
how immaterial substance should act on matter. But is not God an imma-
terial substance? And does he not act on matter? And what greater diffi-
culty is there in conceiving how an immaterial substance should act on
matter than in conceiving how matter acts on matter? ls it not as easy to
conceive how certain parts of matter may be obliged to follow the motions
and affections of the soul without corporeal contact, as that certain par-
tions of matter should be obliged to follow each other's motions by the

adhesion of parts, which no mechanism can account for, or that rays of
light should reflect regularly from a surface which they never touch? 167 Of
this, Sir Isaac Newton in his Op ties has given us several evident and ocular
experiments.
    Nor is it less surprising to find this assertion again repeated in express
words that, after the first creation of things (sec. 115-6), the continuation
of the motions of the heavenly bodies, and the formation of plants and
animals, and every motion of the bodies both of men and all other ani-
mals, is as mechanical as the motions of a clock. Whoever entertains this
opinion is (I think) obliged in reason to be able to explain particularly by
what laws of mechanism the planets and comets can continue to move in
the orbs they do, through unresisting spaces, and by what mechanical laws
both plants and animals are formed, and how the infinitely various spon-
taneous motions of animals and men are performed. 168 This, I am fully
persuaded, is as impossible to make out as it would be to show how a
house or city could be built, or the world itself have been at first formed
by mere mechanism, without any intelligent and active cause. That things
could not be at first produced by mechanism is expressly allowed, and,
when this is once granted, why after that so great concern should be
shown to exclude God's actual goverrunent of the world and to allow his
providence to act no further than barely in concurring (as the phrase is) to
let all things do only what they would do of themselves by mere mecha-
nism, and why it should be thought that God is under any obligation or
confinement either in nature or wisdom never to bring about anything in
the universe, but what is possible for a corporeal machine to accomplish
by mere mechanic laws after it is once set a going, I can no way conceive.
    117. This learned author's allowing in this place that there is greater
and less in true m iracles, and that angels are capable of working some true
miracles, is perfectly contradictory to that notion of the nature of a mira-
de, 169 which he has all along pleaded for in these papers.
    118- 123. That the sun attracts the earth through the intermediate void
space, that is, that the earth and sun gravitate toward each other or tend
(whatever is the cause of that tendency) toward each other with a force
which is in a direct proportion to their masses, or magnitudes and densities
together, and in an inverse duplicate proportion of their distances, and that
the space between them is void, that is, has nothing in it which sensibly
resists the motion of bodies passing transversely through, all this is no th-

ing but a phenomenon or actual matter of fact found by experience. That
this phenomenon is not produced (sec. 118) sans moyen, that is without
some cause capable of producing such an effect, is undoubtedly true. Phi-
losophers therefore may search after and discover that cause, if they can,
whether it is it mechanical or not mechanical. But if they cannot discover
the cause, is therefore the effect itself, the phenomenon, or the matter of
fact discovered by experience (which is all that is meant 170 by the words
attraction and gravitation) ever the less true? Or is a manifest quality to be
called (sec. 122) occult because the immediate efficient cause of it (perhaps)
is occult or not yet discovered? When a body (sec. 123) moves in a circle
without flying off in the tangent, it is certain there is something that hin-
ders it, but if in some cases it is not mechanically (sec. 123) explicable, or is
not yet discovered what that something is, does it therefore follow that the
phenomenon itself is false? This is very singular arguing indeed.
    124--130. The phenomenon itself, the attraction, gravitation, or ten-
dency of bodies toward each other (or whatever other name you please to
call it by), and the laws or proportions of that tendency, are now suffi-
ciently known by observations and experiments. If this or any other
)earned author can explain these phenomena by (sec. 124) the laws of
mechanism, he will not only not be contradicted, but will moreover have
the abundant thanks of the )earned world. But, in the meantime, to (sec.
128) compare gravitation (which is a phenomenon or actual matter of
fact) with Epicurus' declination of atoms (which, according to his corrupt
and atheistic perversion of some more ancient and perhaps better philoso-
phy was a hypothesis or fiction only, and an impossible one too in a world
where no intelligence was supposed to be present) seems to be a very
extraordinary method of reasoning.
    As to the great principle of a (sec. 125, etc.) sufficient reason, all that
this learned writer here adds concerning it is only by way of affirming and
not proving his conclusion, and therefore needs no answer. I shall only
observe that the phrase is of an equivocal signification and may either be
so understood as to mean necessity only or so as to include likewise will
and choice. That in general there (sec. 125) is a sufficient reason why
everything is, which is, is undoubtedly true and agreed on all hands. But
the question is whether in some cases, when it may be highly reasonable to
act, yet different possible ways of acting may not possibly be equally rea-
sonable, and whether, in such cases, the bare will of God 171 is not itself a
sufficient reason for acting in this or the other particular manner, and
whether in cases where there are the strongest possible reasons altogether

on one side, yet in all intelligent and free agents the princip le of action (in
which I think the essence of liberty consists) is not a distinct thing from
the motive or reason which the agent has in his view. All these are con-
stantly denied by this learned writer. And his (sec. 20 and 125, etc.) laying
down his great princip le of a sufficient reason in such a sense as to exclude
all these, and expecting it should be granted him in that sense, without
proof, this is what I call his petitio principii, or begging of the question,
than which nothing can be more unphilosophical.

  l. God, according to my opinion, is an extramundane Intelligence, as
Martianus Capelli calls him, or rather a supramundane lntelligence. 3
    2. We must know that a spontaneity strictly speaking is common to us
and all simple substances, and that, in an intelligent or free substance, this
amounts to a dominion over its own actions.... By nature every simple
substance has perception.. . .4
    But active force contains a certain act or entelechy, and is some-
thing of a middle nature between the faculty of acting and act itself; it
involves a conatus or endeavor, and is of itself carried into action and
stands in need of no help, but only that the impediment is taken away.
This may be illustrated by the examples of a heavy body stretching
the string by which it is hung or of a how bent. For though gravity or
elasticity can and ought to be explained mechanically by the motion
of ether, yet the ultimate cause of the motion in matter is a force
impressed at the creation, which is in every part of matter but,
according to the course of nature, is variously limited and restrained
by bodies striking against each other. And this active faculty I affirm
to be in all substance, and that some action is always arising from it,
so that not even corporeal substance, any more than spiritual sub-
stance, ever ceases to act. This seems not to have been apprehended
by those who have placed the essence of bodies in extension alone, or
even in impenetrability, and who thought they could conceive of bod-
ies as absolutely at rest. It will appear also from what I have advanced
that one created substance does not receive from another the active
force itself, but only the limits and determination of the endeavor or

active faculty already preexisting in it. 5
    To act is the characteristic of substances.6
    This primitive active power is of itself in all corporeal substance, for I
think that a body absolutely at rest is inconsistent with the nature of things?
    On account of its form every body always acts.8
    The active power, which is in the form, and the inertia, or resistance to
motion, which is in the matter.9
    Though I admit an active and, so to speak, vital principle superior to
the common notion of matter everywhere in bodies. 10
    I have elsewhere explained, although it is a thing perhaps not yet well
understood by all, that the very substance of things consists in the power
of acting and being acted upon. 11
    So that, not only everything that acts is a single substance, but also
every individual substance does perpetually act, not excepting even body
itself, in which there is never any absolute rest. 12
    If we ascribe to our own minds an inherent force for producing imma-
nent actions or, which is the same thing, for acting immanently, then it is
no way unreasonable, in fact, to suppose that there is the same power in
other souls or forms, or, if it is a better expression, in the natures of sub-
stances-unless a man will imagine that, in the whole extent of nature
within the compass of our knowledge, our own minds are the only things
with active powers, or that all power of acting immanently and vitally, if I
may so speak, is joined to an intellect. These kinds of assertions, certainly,
are neither founded on any reason nor can be maintained except in oppo-
sition to truth. 13
    Hence we may gather that there must be in corporeal substance an
original entelechy or, as it were, a first subject of activity, that is, there
must be in it a primitive motive power, which, being added over and above
the extension (or that which is merely geometrical) and over and above the
bulk (or that which is merely material), always acts, but yet is variously
modified by the bodies striking against each other through conatus and

impetus. And it is that substantial principle, which in living substances is
called soul and in other things the substantial form. 14
   Prime matter is indeed merely passive, but it is not a complete sub-
stance. To make it complete substance, there must be in addition a soul, or
a form analogous to soul, or an original entelechy, that is, a certain urge or
primitive force of acting, which is an inherent law, impressed by the
decree of God. I think this opinion is not different from that of an erni-
neot ingenious gentleman who recently maintained that body consists of
matter and spirit, meaning by the word spirit not (as he does usually) an
intelligent being, but a soul or form analogous to soul, and not a simple
modification, but as something constituent, substantial, and enduring,
what I usually call a monad, in which there is something like perception
and appetite. 15
   On the contrary, I believe that it is consistent with neither the order
nor beauty, nor reason of things that there should be a vital principle or
power of acting immanently only in a very small part of matter, when it
would be an argument of greater perfection for it to be in all matter. And
nothing prevents there being souls or at least something analogous to
souls everywhere, even if dominant and intelligent souls, such as are
human souls, cannot be everywhere. 16
   What does not act, what lacks active force, what is void of discrim-
inability, what lacks the whole ground and foundation for subsistence, can
no way be a substance. 17
   3. Mr. Bayle has shown enough (in his Reply to a Provincia/, chap. 139,
pp. 748 et seq.) that the soul may be compared to a balance, where reasons
and inclinations take the place of weights. According to him, the manner
of our forming our resolutions may be explained by the hypothesis that
the will of man is like a balance, which stands unmoved when the weights
in both scales are equal and always turns on one side or the other in pro-
portion as one scale has more weight in it than the other. A new reason
makes a heavier weight, a new idea strikes the mind more vigorously than
an old one. The fear of a great pain determines more strongly than the
expectation of a pleasure. When two passions contend against each other,
the stronger always remains master of the field, unless the other is assisted
either by reason or some other contributing passion. 18

    A man has always so much more difficulty in determining himself as
the opposite reasons draw nearer to an equality, just as we see a balance
turn so much the more readily as the weights in each scale are more dif-
ferent from one another. However, since there are often more than two
ways to choose from, we may, therefore, instead of the balance, compare
the soul to a force which has at one and the same time a tendency many
ways, but acts on that part only where it finds the greatest ease or the least
resistance. For example, air strongly compressed in a glass vessel will
break it to get out. lt presses upon every part, but finally makes its way
where the glass is weakest. Thus the inclinations of the soul tend toward
all apparent goods, and these are the antecedent acts of will, but the con-
sequent will, which is the result, is determined toward that good which
affects us the most strongly. 19
    4. There is never any such thing as an indifference in equilibrium, that
is, where every circumstance is perfectly equal on both sides, so that there
is no inclination to one side rather than the other. 20
    lt is true, if the case [of the ass standing between two green fields and
equally liking both of them] was possible, we would have to say that the
ass would starve himself to death; but fundamentally the case is impossi-
ble, unless God brings about the thing on purpose.21
   5. This is a consequence of my system of a pre-established harmony,
which it may be necessary to give some account of here. The scholastic
philosophers believed that the soul and body mutually affected each other
by a natural influence, but since it has been well considered, that
thoughr2 and extended mass have no connection with each other, and are
beings that differ toto genere, many modem philosophers have acknowl-
edged that there is no physical communication between the soul and the
body, despite the metaphysical communication always subsisting, by means
of which the soul and the body make up one suppositum, or what we call a
person. If there was any physical communication between them, then the
soul could change the degree of speed and the line of direction of some
motions in the body, and, vice versa, the body could cause a change in the
series of thoughts that are in the soul. But such an effect as this cannot be
deduced from the notion of anything we can conceive in the body and

soul, though nothing is better known to us23 than the soul, because it is
most intimate to us, that is, most intimate to itself. 24
    I cannot help to arrive at the system which declares that God created
the soul in such a manner at first that it must produce within itself and
represent in itself successively what passes in the body, and that he has
made the body also in such manner that it must of itself do what the soul
orders. Consequently the laws that link the thoughts of the soul follow in
the order of final causes and according to the evolution of perceptions
arising within itself, must produce images that meet and harmonize with
the impressions made by bodies upon our organs of sense; and the laws by
which the mo tions of the body follow each other successively in the order
of efficient causes likewise meet and harmonize with the thoughts of the
soul, in such manner as that these laws of motion make the body act at the
same time that the soul wills. 25
    Mr. Jaquelot has very well shown in his book on the Conformity ofReason
with Faith, that it is just as if he who knows everything I shall order my foot-
man to do tomorrow the whole day long should make a machine resemble
my footman exactly and perform punctually everything I directed all day
tomorrow; this would not at all hinder my freely ordering whatever I pleased,
although the actions of my machine footman would not be in the least free.26
   The true means by which God causes the soul to have sensations of
what passes in the body arises from the nature of the soul, which repre-
sents bodies and is so constituted beforehand that the representations that
are to arise in it, one following another according to the natural succession
of thoughts, correspond to the changes that happens in bodiesP
   6. ln like manner, should it be the will of God that the organs of
human bodies should conform to the will of the soul, according to the sys-
tem of occasional causes, such a law would come into operation only
through perpetual miracles. 28
   7. lndeed, we must admit, rather, that matter resists motion by a cer-
tain natural inertia, as Kepler properly named it, so that matter is not

 23. Clarke notes: "As the eye does not see itself, and if a man had never seen an-
other's eye, nor the image of his own in a glass, he could never have had any notion
what an eye is, so the soul does not differ in its substance."

indifferent to motion and rest, as is commonly supposed, but needs a
greater active force to put it in motion, in proportion to its size.29
   There is natural inertia opposed to motion. 30
   A certain sluggishness, so to speak, that is, an opposition to motion. 31
   A sluggishness or resistance to motion in matter. 32
   The experiments of bodies striking against each other, as well as rea-
son, show that twice as much force is required to give the same speed to a
body of the same kind of matter, but double in size.33 This would not be
necessary if matter was absolutely indifferent to rest and motion, and if
that natural inertia I spoke of did not give it a sort of repugnance to
motion. 34
   lt might be expected, considering the indifference of matter to motion
and rest, that the largest body at rest could be carried away without any
resistance by the smallest body in motion, in which case there would be
action without reaction and an effect greater than its cause. 35

    8. That is why, if God made a general law that bodies should be
attracted to one another, it could be put into operation only by perpetual
miracles. 36

   9. The same may be said concerning perfect wisdom, which is no less
orderly than mathematics, that if there was not a best (optimum) among all
the possible worlds, God would not have made any at all. 37

both in the whole and in every part, the one enclosed in the other so as
that there is not even the smallest gap between them, then, whether the

to say more) could discover no difference between the state of these
spheres at different times, nor find any way of disceming whether the

enclosed sphere is at rest, or revolves, or with what law of motion it
turned. 38
    ll. ln my system ofpre-established harmony, I show that by nature every
simple 39 substance has perception, and that its individuality consists in
the perpetual law that makes its appointed succession of perceptions arise
naturally from one another, so as to represent to it its own body and, by
the same means, the whole universe, according to the point of view proper
to that simple substance, without its needing to receive any physical influ-
ence from the body. And the body likewise, on its part, acts correspond-
ingly to the volitions of the soul by its own laws, and consequently only
obeys the soul in correspondence with those laws.40
    lt must also be confessed that every soul represents to itself the uni-
verse according to its point of view and through a relation pro per to it; but
there is always a perfect harmony between them.41
    The operation of spiritual machines, that is, of souls, is not mechani-
cal, but it contains eminently whatever is excellent in mechanism; the
motions that appear actually in bodies are concentrated by representation
in the soul, as in an ideal world, which expresses the laws of the actual
world and their consequences, but with this difference from the perfect
ideal world which is in God, that most of the perceptions in human souls
are but confused. For we must know that every simple substance
embraces the universe in its confused perceptions or sensations, and that
the succession of these perceptions is regulated by the particular nature of
the substance, but in a manner which always expresses all universal
nature. And every present perception leads to a new perception, just as
every motion which such perception represents leads to another motion.
But it is impossible for the soul to know distinctly its whole nature and
consciously perceive how this innumerable number of little perceptions,
heaped up, or rather concentrated together, are produced. To that end, it
would be required that the soul understood perfectly the whole universe
which is included within them, that is, it would have to be a God.42

free actions by what he calls an intense inward sensation is altogether
inconclusive. We cannot, strictly speaking, be sensible of our indepen-
dence, for we cannot always consciously perceive the often imperceptible
causes on which our resolutions depend. lt is as if a magnetic needle was
sensible of and pleased with its turning toward the north; for it would
believe that it turned itself, independently of any other cause, not con-
sciously perceiving the insensible motions of the magnetic matter. 43
   13. An infinite number of great and small motions, internal and exter-
nal, concur with us, which most often we do not consciously perceive.
And I have already said that when someone walks out of a room, there are
such reasons that determine him to set one foot forward rather than the
other, without his reflecting on it. 44

l. Principia, Scholium to Definitions
   Up to now I have defined terms that are less known and explained the
sense I would have them understood in the following discourse. I do not
define time, space, place, and motion, since they are well known to all.
Only I must observe that the common people conceive those quantities
under no other notions than from their relation to sensible objects. And
from this certain prejudices arise, for the removing of which it will be
convenient to distinguish the terms into absolute and relative, true and
apparent, mathematical and common.
   l. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own
nature, flows uniformly without relation to anything external, and by
another name is called duration. Relative, apparent, and common time is
some sensible and external (whether accurate or varying in rate) measure
of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of
true time, such as an hour, a day, a month, a year.

     Il. Absolute space, in its own nature, without relation to anything
external, always remains similar and immovable. Relative space is some
movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces, which our senses
determine by its position to bodies and is commonly taken for immovable
space, such as the dimension of subterraneous, aerial, or celestial space,
determined by its position with respect to earth. Absolute and relative
space are the same in form and magnitude, but they do not always remain
numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves, a space of our
air, which relatively and with respect to the earth always remains the
same, will at one time be one part of the absolute space into which the air
passes, at another time it will be another part of the same, and so, abso-
lutely understood, it will be continually changed.

     Ill. Place is a part of space that a body takes up, and is absolute or rela-
tive according to the space. I say, a part of space, not the situation nor the
external surface of the body. For the places of equal solids are always
equal, but their surfaces, by reason of their dissimilar figures, are often
unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor are they so much the
places themselves as the properties of places. The motion of the whole is
the same as the sum of the motions of the parts, that is, the translation of
the whole out of its place is the same thing as the sum of the translations
of the parts out of their places; and therefore the place of the whole is the
same as the sum of the places of the parts, and for that reason it is internal
and in the whole body.

    IV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute
place into another, and relative motion the translation from one relative
place into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative place of a body is
that part of the ship the body possesses, or that part of the cavity the body
fills, and which therefore moves together with the ship; and relative rest is
the continuance of the body in the same part of the ship or of its cavity.
But real, absolute rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of
that immovable space, in which the ship itself, its cavity, and all that it
contains, is moved. For that reason, if the earth is really at rest, the body
which relatively rests in the ship will really and absolutely move with the
same velocity which the ship has on the earth. But if the earth also moves,
the true and absolute motion of the body will arise, partly from the true
motion of the earth in immovable space, partly from the relative motion of
the ship on the earth; and if the body moves also relatively in the ship, its
true motion will arise, partly from the true motion of the earth in immov-
able space, and partly from the relative motions as well of the ship on the
earth as of the body in the ship; and from these relative motions will arise
the relative motion of the body on the earth. As if that part of the earth,
B: Selections from Newton's Works                                            97

where the ship is, was truly moved toward the east with a velocity of
10,010 units, while the ship itsel~ with a fresh gale and full sails, is carried
toward the west with a velocity expressed by ten of those units, while a
sailor walks in the ship toward the east, with one unit of the said velocity,
then the sailor will be moved truly in immovable space toward the east
with a velocity of 10,001 units, and relatively on the earth toward the west
with a velocity of nine of those units.
    Absolute time is distinguished from relative in astronomy by the equa-
tion or correction of the apparent time. For the natural days are truly
unequal, though they are commonly considered as equal and used for a
measure of time; astronomers correct this inequality that they may mea-
sure the celestial motions by a more accurate time. lt may be that there is
no such thing as a uniform motion by which time may be accurately mea-
sured. All motions may be accelerated and retarded, but the flowing of
absolute time is not liable to any change. The duration or perseverance of
the existence of things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or
slow or none at all; and therefore this duration ought to be distinguished
from what are only sensible measures of it, and from which we deduce it by
means of the astronomical equation. The necessity of this equation for
determining the times of a phenomenon is established as well from the
experiments of the pendulum clock as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.
    As the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of
the parts of space. Suppose these parts to be moved out of their places,
and they will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out of them-
selves. For times and spaces are, as it were, the places as well of them-
selves as of all other things. All things are placed in time as to order of
succession, and in space as to order of situation. lt is from their essence or
nature that they are places, and it is absurd that the primary places of
things should be movable. These are therefore the absolute places, and
translations out of those places are the only absolute motions.
    But because the parts of space cannot be seen or distinguished from
one another by our senses, we use sensible measures of them in their
stead. For from the positions and distances of things from any body con-
sidered as immovable, we define all places, and then with respect to such
places, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from
some of those places into others. And so, instead of absolute places and
motions, we use relative ones, and that without any inconvenience in com-
mon affairs; but in philosophical disquisitions, we ought to abstract from
our senses and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only
sensible measures of them. For it may be that there is no body really at
rest to which the places and motions of others may be referred.
98                                                                  Appendices

    But we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one
from the other by their properties, causes, and effects. It is a property of
rest that bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And there-
fore as it is possible that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or per-
haps far beyond them, there may be some body absolutely at rest, but
impossible to know, from the position of bodies to one another in our
regions, whether any of these do keep the same position to that remote
body, it follows that absolute rest cannot be determined from the position
of bodies in our regions.
   It is a property of motion that the parts, which retain given positions to
their wholes, do partake of the motions of those who les. For all the parts
of revolving bodies endeavor to recede from the axis of motion, and the
impetus of bodies moving forwards arises from the joint impetus of all the
parts. Therefore, if surrounding bodies are moved, those that are rela-
tively at rest within them will partake of their motion. Because of this, the
true and absolute motion of a body cannot be determined by the transla-
tion of it from those which only seem to rest; for the external bodies
should not only appear at rest, but be really at rest. For otherwise, all
included bodies, besides their translation from near the surrounding
ones, partake likewise of their true motions; and though that translation
was not made, they would not be really at rest, but only seem to be so. For
the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the surrounded as the
exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the shell does to the ker-
nel; but if the shell moves, the kernel will also move, as being part of the
whole, without any removal from near the shell.
    A property related to the preceding is that if a place is moved, what-
ever is placed in it moves along with it; and therefore a body which is
moved from a place in motion partakes also of the motion of its place.
Upon which account, all motions, from places in motion, are no other
than parts of entire and absolute motions, and every entire motion is com-
posed of the motion of the body out of its first place, and the motion of
this place out of its place, and so on, until we come to some immovable
place, as in the aforementioned example of the sailor. Because of this,
entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined than by
immovable places; and for that reason I did before refer those absolute
motions to immovable places, but relative ones to movable places. Now no
other places are immovable but those that, from infinity to infinity, do all
retain the same given position one to another, and upon this account must
ever remain unmoved, and do as a result constitute immovable space.
   The causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished from
one another are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.
True motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force
B: Selections from Newton's Works                                         99

impressed upon the body moved; but relative motion may be generated or
altered without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient
only to im press some force on other bodies with which the former is com-
pared, that by their giving way, that relation in which the relative rest or
motion of this other body did consist may be changed. Again, true motion
always suffers some change from any force impressed upon the moving
body; but relative motion does not necessarily undergo any change by
such forces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other
bodies, with which the comparison is made, that the relative position may
be preserved, then that condition will be preserved in which the relative
motion consists. And therefore any relative motion may be changed when
the true motion remains unaltered, and the relative may be preserved
when the true suffers some change. Thus, true motion by no means con-
sists in such relations.
    The effects that distinguish absolute from relative motion are the
forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are no such
forces in a purely relative circular motion, but in a true and absolute cir-
cular motion, they are greater or less, according to the quantity of the
motion. If a vessel hung by a long cord is so often tumed about that the
cord is strongly twisted, then filled with water and held at rest together
with the water, at once, by the sudden action of another force, it is whirled
about the contrary way, and while the cord is untwisting itself, the vessel
continues for some time in this motion, the surface of the water will at
first be even, as before the vessel began to move; but after that the vessel,
by gradually communicating its motion to the water, will make it begin to
revolve sensibly and recede gradually from the middle, and ascend to the
sides of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure (as l have experi-
enced); and the swifter the motion becomes, the higher will the water rise,
until at last, performing its revolutions in the same times with the vessel,
it becomes relatively at rest in it. This ascent of the water shows its
endeavor to recede from the axis of its motion, and the true and absolute
circular motion of the water, which is here directly contrary to the rela-
tive, becomes known and may be measured by this endeavor. At first,
when the relative motion of the water in the vessel was greatest, it pro-
duced no endeavor to recede from the axis; the water showed no tendency
to the circumference, nor any ascent toward the sides of the vessel, but
remained of an even surface, and therefore its true circular motion had
not yet begun. But afterwards, when the relative motion of the water had
decreased, its ascent toward the sides of the vessel proved its endeavor to
recede from the axis; and this endeavor showed the real circular motion of
the water continually increasing, until it had acquired its greatest quantity
when the water rested relatively in the vessel. And therefore this endeavor
100                                                              Appendices

does not depend upon any translation of the water in respect of the ambi-
ent bodies, nor can true circular motion be defined by such translation.
There is only one real circular motion of any one revolving body corre-
sponding to only one power of endeavoring to recede from its axis of
motion as its proper and adequate effect; but relative motions in one and
the same body are innumerable, according to the various relations it bears
to extemal bodies, and like other relations are altogether destitute of any
real effect, except insofar as they may perhaps partake of that unique true
motion. And therefore in the system of those who suppose that our heav-
ens revolving below the sphere of the fixed stars carry the planets along
with them, the several parts of those heavens and the planets, which are
indeed relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet really move. For they
change their position one to another (which never happens to bodies truly
at rest), and being carried together with their heavens, partake of their
motions, and as parts of revolving wholes, endeavor to recede from the
axis of their motions. For that reason relative quantities are not the quan-
tities themselves, whose names they bear, but those sensible measures of
them (either accurate or inaccurate ), which are commonly used instead of
the measured quantities themselves. And if the meaning of words is to be
determined by their use, then by the names time, space, place, and
motion, their sensible measures are properly to be understood; and the
expression will be unusual, and purely mathematical, if the measured
quantities themselves are meant. On this account, those who interpret
these words for the measured quantities violate the accuracy of language,
which ought to be kept precise. Nor do those who confound real quanti-
ties with their relations and sensible measure defile the purity of mathe-
matical and philosophical truths any less.
    It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover and effectually to
distinguish the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent,
because the parts of that immovable space in which those mo tions are per-
formed do by no means come under the observation of our senses. Yet the
thing is not altogether desperate; for we have some arguments to guide us,
partly from the apparent motions, which are the differences of the true
motions, partly from the forces, which are the causes and effects of the
true motions. For instance, if two globes, kept at a given distance one from
the other by means of a cord that connects them, were revolved about
their common center of gravity, we might, from the tension of the cord,
discover the endeavor of the globes to recede from the axis of their
motion, and from this we might compute the quantity of their circular
motions. And then if any equal forces should be impressed at once on the
alternate faces of the globes to augment or diminish their circular
motions, from the increase or decrease of the tension of the cord, we
B: Selections from Newton's Works                                         101

might infer the increase or decrease of their motions; and hence would be
found on what faces those forces ought to be impressed, that the motions
of the globes might be most augmented, that is, we might discover their
hindmost faces, or those which do follow in the circular motion. But the
faces which follow being known, and consequently the opposite ones that
precede, we should likewise know the determination of their motions.
And thus we might find both the quantity and the determination of this
circular motion, even in an immense vacuum, where there was nothing
external or sensible with which the globes could be compared. But now, if
some remote bodies that kept always a given position one to another were
placed in that space, as the fixed stars do in our regions, we could not
indeed determine, from the relative translation of the globes among those
bodies, whether the motion did belong to the globes or to the bodies. But
if we observed the cord and found that its tension was that very tension
which the motions of the globes required, we might conclude the motion
to be in the globes and the bodies to be at rest; and then, lastly, from the
translation of the globes among the bodies, we should find the determina-
tion of their motions. But how we are to obtain the true motions from
their causes, effects, and apparent differences, and the converse, shall be
explained more at large in the following treatise. For to this end it was that
I composed it.


2. Principia, General Scholium46
   The hypothesis of vortices is pressed by many difficulties. ln order
that any planet may describe areas proportional to the time by a radius
drawn to the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the vortices should
observe the square of their distances from the sun; but in order that the
periodic times of the planets may obtain the 3/2th power of their dis-
tances from the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the vortex ought
to be as the 3/2th power of their distances. ln order that the smaller vor-
tices may maintain their lesser revolutions about Saturn, Jupiter, and
other planets, and float quietly and undisturbed in the greater vortex of
the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the solar vortex should be
equal. But the rotation of the sun and planets about their axes, which
ought to correspond with the motions of their vortices, are in disagree-
ment with all these ratios. The mo tions of the comets are exceedingly
regular, are governed by the same laws as the mot ions of the planets, and
cannot be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices. For comets are

102                                                               Appendices

carried in highly eccentric motions through all parts of the heavens,
which is incompatible with the notion of a vortex.
    Projectiles in our air feel only the resistance of the air. If the air is
removed, as is done in Mr. Boyle's vacuum, the resistance ceases, for a bit
of fine down and a piece of solid gold fall with equal velocity in this void.
And the same argument must apply to the celestial spaces above the earth's
atmosphere; in these spaces, where there is no air to resist their motions,
all bodies will move with complete freedom and the planets and comets
will constantly revolve in orbits given in shape and position, according to
the laws above explained. But although these bodies may, indeed, carry on
in their orbits by the mere laws of gravity, they could by no means have
attained the regular position of the orbi ts through these laws.
    The six primary planets revolve about the sun in circles concentric
with the sun, in the same direction of motion and almost in the same
plane. Ten moons revolve about the earth, Jupiter, and Saturn in concen-
tric circles, in the same direction of motion, and nearly in the planes of
the orbits of those planets. But it is not to be conceived that mere
mechanical causes could give birth to so many regular motions, since the
comets range over all parts of the heavens in very eccentric orbits. ln this
kind of motion, the comets pass easily through the orbits of the planets
and with great rapidity; and at their aphelions, where they move the slow-
est and delay the longest, they recede to the greatest distances from each
other, and hence suffer the least disturbance from their mutual attrac-
tions. This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could
only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and power-
ful Being. And if the fixed stars are the centers of similar other systems,
since these are formed by the same counsel, they must all be subject to the
dominion of One, especially since the light of the fixed stars is of the same
nature as the light of the sun and light passes into all the other systems
from every system <; and so that the systems of the fixed stars should not
fall on each other by their gravity, he has placed those systems at immense
distances from one another>.
    This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord
over all; and because of his dominion he is usually called Lord God Pan-
tokrator, or Universal Ruler. For God is a relative word, and is relative to
servants, and Deity is the dominion of God, not over his own body, as
those imagine who imagine God to be the world soul, but over servants.
The supreme God is a Being etemal, infinite, absolutely perfect; but a
being, however perfect, without dominion, cannot be said to be Lord
God. For we say, my God, your God, the God of Israel, <the God of
Gods, and Lord of Lords,> but we do not say, my Eternal, your Eternal,
the Eternal of Israel <, the Eternal of Gods; we do not say, my lnfinite or
B: Selections from Newton's Works                                                    103

my Perfect>. These are titles which have no relation to servants. The
word God 47 usually signifies Lord, but not every Lord is God. lt is the
dominion of a spiritual being that constitutes God-a true, supreme, or
imaginary dominion makes a true, supreme, or imaginary God. From his
true dominion it follows that the true God is a living, intelligent, and
powerful Being, and, from his other perfections, that he is supreme or
most perfect. He is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omniscient; that
is, he endures from eternity to eternity and is present from infinity to
infinity; he governs all things and knows all things that are or can be done.
He is not eternity and infinity, but etemal and infinite; he is not duration
and space, but he endures and is present. He endures forever and is
present everywhere, and, by existing always and everywhere, he consti-
tutes duration and space. Since every particle of space is always, and every
indivisible moment of duration is everywhere, certainly the Maker and
Lord of all things cannot be never and nowhere. <Every sentient soul is
still the same indivisible person at different times and in different organs
of sense and motion. Successive parts are given in duration, coexistent
parts in space, but neither is given in the person of a man or his thinking
principle, and much less can they be found in the thinking substance of
God. Every person, insofar as he is a sentient being, is one and the same
person during his whole life, in each and all of his organs of sense. God is
the same God always and everywhere. > God is omnipresent not only vir-
tually, but also substantially, for virtues cannot subsist without substance.
ln him48 are all things contained and move d, yet neither affects the other.
God is not affected by the motion of bodies and bodies do not experience
any resistance from God's omnipresence. It is allowed by all that the
supreme God exists necessarily, and by the same necessity he exists always

 47. Newton's marginal note: "Dr. Pocock derives the Latin word Deus from the
Arabic du (in the oblique case d•), which signifies the Lord. And in this sense pr in ces
are called gods, Psalm 84.6 and John 10.45. And Moses is called a god to his brother
Aaron and a god to Pharaoh (Exodus 4.16 and 7.1). And in the same sense the souls
of dead princes were formerly called gods by the heathens, but falsely, because of
their lack of dominion."
 48. Newton's marginal note: "This was the opinion of the ancients, such as
Pythagoras (in Cicero, On the Nature ofthe Gods, book 1), Thales, Anaxagoras, Vir-
gil (Georgzcs 4.220 and A eneid 6.721), Philo (A/legories, at the beginning of book l)
Aratus (Phenomena, at the beginning). So also the sacred writers, as Saint Paul
(Acts 17.27-28), Saint John 14.2, Moses (Deuteronomy 4.39 and 10.14), David
(Psalm 139.7- 9), Solomon (l Kmgs8.27),Job 22. 12-14,Jeremiah 23.23- 24. More-
over, the idolaters supposed that the sun, moon, and stars, the souls of men, and
other parts of the world are parts of the Supreme God, and are therefore to be wor-
shipped, but falsely."

and everywhere. Hence also he is all similar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all
arm, all power to perceive, to understand, and to act, but in a manner not
at all human, in a manner not at all corporeal, in a manner entirely
unknown to us. As a blind man has no idea of colors, so have we no idea of
the manner by which the all-wise God perceives and understands all
things. He is entirely void of all body and bodily shape, and therefore can-
not be seen, nor heard, nor touched; nor ought he be worshipped under
the image of any corporeal thing. We have ideas of his attributes, but we
do not know what the real substance of anything is. We see only the shapes
and colors of bodies, we hear only sounds, we touch only the external sur-
faces, we smeli only the odors, and taste the flavors; we do not know the
inmost substances by our senses or by any act of reflection; much less,
then, do we have any idea of the substance of God. We know him only
through his most wise and excellent contrivances of things and final
causes; we admire him for his perfections, but we revere and adore him on
account of his dominion. <For we adore him as his servants, and a god
without dominion, providence, and final causes is nothing else but fate
and nature. No variation of things can arise from blind metaphysical
necessity, which is certainly the same always and everywhere. All the
diversity of natural things that we find suited to different times and places
could only have arisen from the ideas and will of a Being existing neces-
sarily. But, by way of allegory, God is said to see, to speak, to laugh, to
love, to hate, to desire, to give, to receive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight,
to frame, to work, to build. For all our notions of God are taken from the
ways of mankind by a certain similitude, which, though not perfect, has
some Iikeness, however>. And this much concerning God, about whom a
discourse from the appearances of things does certainly belong to natural
philosophy.
    Up to now we have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our
sea through the force of gravity, but have not yet assigned the cause for
this. It is certain that it must proceed from a cause that penetrates to the
very centers of the sun and planets with no dim inu tion of force, and that
operates, not according to the quantity of the surfaces of the particles
upon which it acts (as mechanical causes usually do), but according to the
quantity of the solid matter they contain, and which acts at immense dis-
tances, extended everywhere, always decreasing as the inverse square of
the distances. Gravitation toward the sun is made up out of the gravita-
tions toward the individual particles of the body, and in receding from the
sun decreases precisely as the inverse square of the distances as far as the
orbit of Saturn, as is evident from the aphelions of the planets being at
rest, and even to the remotest aphelions of the comets, if those aphelions
are also at rest. But up to now I have not been able to deduce the reason
B: Selections from Newton's Works                                         105

for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypothe-
ses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called a
hypothesis, and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of
occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.
ln this philosophy, particular propositions are deduced from the phenom-
ena and are rendered general by induction. The impenetrability, mobility,
and impetus of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were
discovered in this way. And it is enough that gravity does really exist and
acts according to the laws we have explained, and abundantly serves to
account for all the motions of the celestial bodies and of our sea.
   And now we might add something about a certain extremely subtle
spirit that pervades and lies hidden in all gross bodies, by whose force and
action the particles of bodies attract one another at near distances and
cohere, if brought into contact, and electric bodies act at greater distances,
both repelling and attracting neighboring corpuscles, and light is emitted,
reflected, refracted, inflected, and heats bodies, and all sensation is
aroused, and the members of animals move by the will, that is, by the
vibrations of this spirit, propagated through the solid filaments of the
nerves from the external organs of sense to the brain, and from the brain to
the muscles. But these things cannot be explained in a few words, nor do
we have at hand sufficient experiments by which the laws of action of this
electric and elastic spirit can accurately be determined and demonstrated.


3. Op ties, end of Query 31
   And thus nature will be very conformable to herself and very simple,
performing all the great mo tions of the heavenly bodies by the attraction
of gravity that intercedes between those bodies, and almost all the small
ones of their particles by some other attractive and repelling powers
which intercede between the particles. The vis inertiae is a passive princi-
ple by which bodies persist in their motion or rest, receive motion in pro-
portion to the force impressing it, and resist as much as they are resisted.
By this principle alone there never could have been any motion in the
world. Some other principle was necessary for putting bodies into
motion; and now that they are in motion, some other principle is neces-
sary for conserving the motion. For from the various composition of two
motions, it is very certain that there is not always the same quantity of
motion in the world. For if two globes joined by a slender rod revolve
about their common center of gravity with a uniform motion, while that
center moves on uniformly in a right line drawn in the plane of their cir-
cular motion, the sum of the motions of the two globes, as often as the
globes are in the right line described by their common center of gravity,
106                                                                Appendices

will be big ger than the sum of their motions, when they are in a line per-
pendicular to that right line. By this instance it appears that motion may
be gotten or lost. But by reason of the tenacity of fluids and attrition of
their parts, and the weakness of elasticity in solids, motion is much more
apt to be lost than gotten, and is always upon the decay. For bodies which
are either absolutely hard or so soft as to be void of elasticity will not
rebound from one another. lmpenetrability makes them only stop. If two
equal bodies meet directly in vacuo, they will by the laws of motion stop
where they meet and lose all their motion, and remain in rest unless they
are elastic and receive new motion from their spring. If they have so much
elasticity as suffices to make them rebound with a quarter, or half, or three
quarters of the force with which they come together, they will lose three
quarters or half or a quarter of their motion. And this may be tried by let-
ting two equal pendulums fall against one another from equal heights. If
the pendulums are of lead or soft clay, they will lose all or almost all their
motions; if they are of elastic bodies they will lose all but what they
recover from their elasticity. If it is said that they can lose no motion but
what they communicate to other bodies, the consequence is that in vacuo
they can lose no motion, but when they meet they must go on and pene-
trate one another's dimensions. If three equal round vessels are filled, the
one with water, the other with oil, the third with molten pitch, and the
liquors are stirred about alike to give them a vortical motion, the pitch by
its tenacity will lose its motion quickly, the oil being less tenacious will
keep it longer, and the water being less tenacious will keep it longest but
yet will lose it in a short time. From this it is easy to understand that if
many contiguous vortices of molten pitch were each of them as large as
those which some suppose to revolve about the sun and fixed stars, as
large as the Cartesian vortices, yet these and all their parts would, by their
tenacity and stiffness, communicate their motion to one another until
they all rested among themselves. Vortices of oil or water, or some more
fluid matter, might continue longer in motion, but unless the matter were
void of all tenacity and attrition of parts, and communication of motion
(which is not to be supposed), the motion would constantly decay. Seeing
therefore the variety of motion that we find in the world is always decreas-
ing, there is a necessity of conserving and recruiting it by active princi-
ples, such as are the cause of gravity, by which planets and comets keep
their motions in their orbs and bodies acquire great motion in falling, and
the cause of fermentation, by which the heart and blood of animals are
kept in perpetual motion and heat, the inward parts of the earth are con-
stantly warmed and in some places grow very hot, bodies burn and shine,
mountains take fire, the caverns of the earth are blown up, and the sun
continues violently hot and lucid and warms all things by his light. For we

meet with very little motion in the world besides what is owing either to
these active principles or to the dictates of a will. <And if it were not for
these principles, the bodies of the earth, planets, comets, sun, and all
things in them, would grow cold and freeze and become inactive masses,
and all putrefaction, generation, vegetation, and life would cease, and the
planets and comets would not remain in their orbs. >
    All these things being considered, it seems probable to me that God in
the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, move-
able particles, of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties
and in such proportion to space as most conduced to the end for which
he formed them; and that these primitive particles being solids are
incomparably harder than any porous bodies compounded of them, even
so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces, no ordinary power being
able to divide what God himself made one in the first creation. While the
particles continue entire, they may compose bodies of one and the same
nature and texture in all ages; but should they wear away or break in
pieces, the nature of things de pending on them would be changed. Water
and earth, composed of old worn particles and fragments of particles,
would not be of the same nature and texture now, with water and earth
composed of entire particles in the beginning. And, therefore, that nature
may be lasting, the changes of corporeal things are to be placed only in
the various separations and new associations and mo tions of these perma-
nent particles since compound bodies are apt to break, not in the midst of
solid particles, but where those particles are laid together and only touch
in a few points.
    It seems to me further that these particles have not only a vis inertia
accompanied with such passive laws of motion as naturally result from
that force, but also that they are moved by certain active principles, such
as is that of gravity and that which causes fermentation and the cohesion
of bodies. These principles I consider, not as occult qualities supposed to
result from the specific forms of things, but as general laws of nature, by
which the things themselves are formed, their truth appearing to us by
phenomena, though their causes are not yet discovered. <For these are
manifest qualities and their causes are only occult. And the Aristotelians
gave the name of occult qualities not to manifest qualities, but to such
qualities only as they supposed to lie hidden in bodies and to be the
unknown causes of manifest effects, such as would be the causes of grav-
ity, and of magnetic and electric attractions, and of fermentations, if we
should suppose that these forces or actions arose from qualities unknown
to us and incapable of being discovered and made manifest. Such occult
qualities put a stop to the improvement of natural philosophy, and there-
fore of late years have been rejected.> To tell us that every species of
108                                                                 Appendices

things is endowed with an occult specific quality by which it acts and pro-
duces manifest effects is to tell us nothing, but to derive two or three gen-
eral princip les of motion from phenomena, and afterwards to tell us how
the properties and actions of all corporeal things follow from those mani-
fest principles, would be a very great step in philosophy, though the
causes of those principles were not yet discovered; and therefore I do not
hesitate to propose the principles of motion above mentioned, since they
are of very general extent <, and leave their causes to be found out>.
    Now by the help of these principles all material things seem to have
been composed of the hard and solid particles above mentioned, variously
associated in the first creation by the counsel of an intelligent agent. For it
became him who created them to set them in order. And if he did so, it is
unphilosophical to seek for any other origin of the world, or to pretend
that it might arise out of a chaos by the mere laws of nature, though being
once formed it may continue by those laws for many ages. For while com-
ets move in very eccentric orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could
never make all the planets move one and the same way in concentric orbs,
some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have arisen from
the mutual actions of comets and planets upon one another, and which
will be apt to increase until this system needs a reformation. Such a won-
derful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of
choice. And so must the uniformity in the bodies of animals, they having
generally a right and a left side shaped similarly, and on either side of their
bodies two legs behind and either two arms or two legs or two wings
before upon their shoulders, and between their shoulders a neck running
down into a backbone and a head upon it, and in the head two ears, two
eyes, a nose, a mouth, and a tongue, similarly situated. Also the first con-
trivance of those very artificial parts of animals, the eyes, ears, brain, mus-
cles, heart, lungs, midriff, glands, larynx, hands, wings, swimming
bladders, natural spectacles, and other organs of sense and motion, and
the instinct of brutes and insects can be the effect of nothing else than the
wisdom and skill of a powerful ever-living agent, who, being in all places,
is more able by his will to move the bodies within his boundless uniform
sensorium, and thereby to form and reform the parts of the universe, than
our spirit which is in us the image of God is able by our will to move the
parts of our own bodies. <And yet we are not to consider the world as the
body of God, or the several parts of it as the parts of God. He is a uniform
being, void of organs, members, or parts, and they are his creatures subor-
dinate to him, and subservient to his will; and he is no more the soul of
them than the soul of man is the soul of the species of things carried
through the organs of sense into the place of its sensation, where it per-
ceives them by means of its immediate presence, without the intervention
B: Selections from Newton's Works                                             109

of any third thing. The organs of sense are not for enabling the soul to
perceive the species of things in its sensorium, but only for conveying
them there; and God has no need of such organs, he being everywhere
present to the things themselves.> And since space is divisible in infinitum
and matter is not necessarily in all places, it may be also allowed that God
is able to create particles of matter of several sizes and figures, and in sev-
eral proportions to space, and perhaps of different densities and forces,
and thereby to vary the laws of nature and make worlds of several sorts in
several parts of the universe. At least, l see no contradiction in all this.
    As in mathematics, so in natural philosophy, the investigation of diffi-
cult things by the method of analysis ought ever to precede the method of
composition. This analysis consists in making experiments and observa-
tions, and in drawing general conclusions from them by induction, and
admitting of no objections against the conclusions but such as are taken
from experiments or other certain truths. For hypotheses are not to be
regarded in experimental philosophy. And although the arguing from
experiments and observations by induction is no demonstration of gen-
eral conclusions, yet it is the best way of arguing which the nature of
things admits of, and may be looked upon as so much the stronger by how
much the induction is more general. And if no exception occurs from
phenomena, the conclusion may be pronounced generally. But if at any
time afterwards any exception shall occur from experiments, it may then
begin to be pronounced with such exceptions as occur. By this way of
analysis we may proceed from compounds to ingredients and from
motions to the forces producing them, and in general from effects to
their causes and from particular causes to more general ones, until the
argument ends in the most general. This is the method of analysis; and
the synthesis consists in assuming the causes discovered and established
as principles, and by them explaining the phenomena proceeding from
them and proving the explanations.
    ln the two first books of these Optics I proceeded by this analysis to
discover and prove the original differences of the rays oflight in respect of
refrangibility, reflexibility, and color, and their alternate fits of easy reflec-
tion and easy transmission, and the properties of bodies, both opaque and
pellucid, on which their reflections and colors depend. And these discov-
eries being proved may be assumed in the method of composition for
explaining the phenomena arising from them; l gave an instance of this
method in the end of the First Book. ln this Third Book l have only
begun the analysis of what remains to be discovered about light and its
effects on the frame of nature, hinting several things about it and leaving
the hints to be examined and improved by the further experiments and
observations of such as are inquisitive. And if natural philosophy in all its
110                                                             Appendices

parts, by pursuing this method, shall at length be perfected, the bounds of
moral philosophy will be also enlarged. For so far as we can know by natu-
ral philosophy what is the first cause, what power he has over us, and what
benefits we receive from him, so far our duty toward him as well as that
toward one another will appear to us by the light of nature. And no doubt,
if the worship of false gods had not blinded the heathen, their moral phi-
losophy would have gone further than to the four cardinal virtues; and
instead of teaching the transmigration of souls, and to worship the sun
and moon and dead heroes, they would have taught us to worship our
true author and benefactor, as their ancestors did under the government
of Noah and his sons before they corrupted themselves.
